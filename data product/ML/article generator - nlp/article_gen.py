      <h3><p>Cute, comfy, I got a 9, I usually wear 9.5 a little snug at first, but I broke them in in no time, and now they are very comfortable. Most of all I enjoy wearing this shoe, it is soft, flexible, light feeling, and comfortable. I'm very happy with the color, style, and comfort of these shoes and would consider buying another pair in a different color..</p></h3>

I guess this isn't okay product, I feel like I could have gone to local stores for the same price and gotten better quality. I thought I ordered the pink one, but got a brown one</p></h3>

"Jessie" was a wonderful, smart and beautiful cat and we added a brother for her soon, another Black cat. I bought this mug for my sister whoâ€™s other (less adorable) cat mug broke.</p></h3>

Nice and sturdy, and mine is packed with two toothbrushes, a full size Sensodyne, a tongue scraper and floss picks. I wish I understood the strange magic that hold this to the wall of my shower, but it works, its amazing.</p></h3>
