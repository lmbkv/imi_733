",Size: Medium,"These are almost an exact knock off of a Craftsman model I remember my father had in the 70's/early 80's. Minus the quick release button which now appears on the new Craftsman model too. These work great for building boxes and assembling miter joints. I have already built 3 cabinets and a mirror utilizing these and they worked perfectly. Good clamping strength (for what they are) and easy to setup your angle.I cleaned them with degreaser and clamped some scrap wood. Still ended up with black smudges so I applied blue painters tape to the clamp faces. Not too big of a pain for the value of these clamps.

",Size: Medium,"These very well made right angle clamp have been in use in my shop for 18 months now, I had read the negative reviews and felt since I have been building ""Heirloom Quality"" Custom Woodwork for 30+ years, I should add my ""2 cents"". For someone who knows what a right angle clamp is supposed to be used for , these work very well (I have 10 total) - if your mitered cuts are ""dead-on"" 45 degrees and being that ""end to end grain"" joints are the weakest unless a spline(s) or dowel pin(s) are utilized along with high quality wood glue (apply a skim coat first to fill the grain as end grain will soak up the glue) I tape the edges so glue won't fill the open grain on the face and cause spots where stain will not penetrate, if you are expecting these clamps to ""pull"" a bad cut into place - you should reset your saw or get a miter box, these are for as one other review stated ""a extra set of hands"" I allow my properly assembled joints to stay in these with a minimum amount of pressure for 16 - 24 hours, they will break if dropped and land wrong (they are cast aluminum and brittle plastic handles) They will also hold a ""T"" joint in place to allow the glue to set, but still dowel pin or screw the joint - There is no short-cut for quality and I have burned up a lot of time, wood and $$ learning that ""experience"" is the best teacher, I'm still learning from older and some younger woodworkers- Happy sawdust- and remember ""If you love what you do, you will never work a day in your life"" Thanks to Amazon for allowing everyone to review the items we all can use to better the space we occupy, and to the reviewers as well

As long as the items you're clamping are within the confines of the clamp walls themselves it seems to be able to exert enough pressure to get a good glue bond... say a thin picture frame or such. However if your trying to clamp up anything larger for gluing it just doesn't have the clamping power to to do it.It's extremely cheaply made from the lowest quality materials that could be sourced.

B000JCGYD6,wolfcraft 3415405 Quick-Jaw Right Angle 90 Degree Corner Clamp,3.0,"Great for picture frames, but I've stripped two out of five. UPDATED
",Size: Medium,"UDATE: I've come up with a workaround and fix for the problem.The workaround is to simply add some material (I used five pieces of mat board stacked) to make whats being clamped wider so that the bad part of the threads aren't a factor.The fix is to disable the quick release button. The real problem is that the bad place on the threads is tripping the quick release so it can't be tightened. When I disabled it by wrapping a homemade spacer around the piston behind the button and taping it in place, the clamp tighten just fine. We'll see how long it lasts.UPDATE:I initially gave these a great review, but now I've had two strip out. Admittedly, I really tweak them building picture frames. That's why I'm still giving them three stars.I build picture frames, and I've struggled with cheap clamps from the local hardware store. I had to mount those on corners made of 1x4s to make them usable, but not these clamps. I uploaded a picture of a frame being glued with both types of clamps used together.  I'm ordering two more of these now so that I'll have two of the setups in the picture. I wish I had eight of these, but that's a little pricey.

B000JCGYD6,wolfcraft 3415405 Quick-Jaw Right Angle 90 Degree Corner Clamp,5.0,"Woodworking Made Easy!!
",Size: Medium,"I like this product, because it is like an extra set of hands with built in clamps. I wish that I had bought this clamping jig sooner. I used it for putting together a shelving unit, and it made the job a breeze. The reason I bought this, is to continue building varying woodworking projects. There is no doubt in my mind that I bought a great product.  The clamping force of the product is perfect! Having the screw handle style clamping, really helps to adjust the material you work with; and not wreck your work under too much force. Some people have said that they hate the quick release feature. I have to say, I don't agree with that at all. In fact, I feel as if it makes working with it much better. What's better than being able to quickly release the work when you're done? Especially, if you are cramped for time.  This is hands down, a solid tool. The release buttons look flimsy, as well as the screw handles. Yet, they both work flawlessly. Best purchase for sure!

When I tried to tighten one side it kept slipping through.My assumption is that there's a flimsy plastic piece in that casing were the winding goes through.Maybe it works for tiny frame building, where you just need that as a kind of loose guide.When you want to tighten two boards in a medium duty, this 90 degree angle is NOT what you are looking for!

Not an exaggeration  when I say that all of my woodworking is now easier. You simply push a little red button on either clamp to rapidly move the slide, and then the screws allow you to put some good clamping force on both of the pieces, making them fit nice n' snug.You can mount it on a workbench easily, but I've been doing right angle glue ups on the floor and this thing works great.

",Size: Medium,"Bought two for a basement shelf project.  Things were going great until the third shelf, at which time one of the clamps refused to tighten.  Regardless of what I did, the quick release kept engaging anytime pressure was placed on the clamp to tighten it to the board.  After taking the clamp apart to try to figure out why it was doing this, I noticed the threads on the quick release casting had already started to round over (after less than a dozen uses!!!) and that it would be impossible to fix.

",Size: Medium,"Depends on your project!Great clamp! Larger capacity than most and worked very well. Why only 2 stars you ask? Well, it only worked great for the first 5-6 joints. Now one side works great, the other won't tighten. As you get it tight on the project, tight enough to hold that is, it jumps threads and is loose again. I tried holding down the push button piece to force it to hold, worked well for one more corner. Now even that won't work.I'm hoping to make it still work by cutting that side off and still being able to use a traditional dewalt clamp to hold wood at the 90 degree angle. Definitely not worth the money though, I could have made a jig for less, just figured this would be more convenient. I'll admit I was wrong, big time.

B000JCGYD6,wolfcraft 3415405 Quick-Jaw Right Angle 90 Degree Corner Clamp,4.0,"THREAD FIX - follow up
",Size: Medium,"My first customer review on anything, ever, but I read them and, frankly rely on them sometimes so here goes.I'm a finish carpenter by trade. I do like these clamps and had the thread slipping problem as so many have mentioned. Disappointing as these aren't what I would call cheap. They are cast aluminum BTW, not painted plastic as mentioned. At least all mine are aluminum.Anyhow, rather than cast off the duds, here's something to try. Sorry, no pics. I'm not that techno savvy.On the back of the slide jaw there's a keeper plate attached by 2 phillips head screws. Remove the screws / plate. The jack screw is held in place by a C clip which is now accessable. Remove the C clip. The Jack screw can now be extracted completely past the thread / spring mechanism.In my case, simply stretching the spring to make it stronger has done the trick. Re assemble. The C clip can be a pain to get on / off but its do-able.I have several of these clamps and have had to do this more than once, but beyond that I find the clamps well made and very useful. I hope this easy fix keeps a few of them out of the trash bin. It's definitely a silly flaw but not a deal kill where the clamp is concernedCheersEditAfter having done this fix several times I became aware that the little square threaded ""box"" in there is, for some odd reason, directional. Fix, test, flip, fix again...etc. after figuring this out they've been working great since. Years in use, often daily, Rock solid.Too bad there's this little ""personality flaw"", but in the end these are good clamps. I use them hard. They're also good as a small vice when clamped to a table. Great little clamps. Don't give up on them.

",Size: Medium,"Perfect for what I need it for...holding boards in place so I can screw them together or drill lined up holes. Used it for a couple projects so far and it works well. A couple other reviews have noted that it doesn't hold ""tight"" for gluing. It's not supposed to as that's not really what it's for. The description outright states ""It's useful function of an assembly aid helps in the alignment and clamping of parts for nailing, welding, and screwing."" Key words ""assembly aid"". I don't see the word ""glue"" anywhere in the description. If you are looking for a clamp to squeeze boards together for glue joints, look at the Irwin bar clamps. I have several and they are awesome for that (and other things!).I've also seen other reviews stating they twisted and stripped the clamping screw. Not sure how much pressure they were putting on it. My guess would be a lot (perhaps trying to squeeze boards for gluing?). I clamp my boards pretty tight and they don't move. No issues or worries that it looks or feels like it will break or strip.This tool helps you hold things together temporarily so you can fasten them together permanently with something else. For that purpose, it's perfect.

B000JCGYD6,wolfcraft 3415405 Quick-Jaw Right Angle 90 Degree Corner Clamp,4.0,"effective clamp to replace long clamps
",Size: Medium,"I bought 4 of these to assemble a large bookcase I built recently. They were fairly effective for pulling in a datoed shelf. I found it much more effective to clamp tight on the shelf with some gap between the inside of the clamp and my outer board. Then I pulled in the shelf with the perpendicular clamp.For another project, I used the clamps to make a connection on the outside edge if a 90° corner. I glued and doweled the first corner without first checking if it was square. Turns out it was at least a 1/4"" out of square over 2'. I managed to pull everything back into square on the other corners to remedy, but I spent a lot of time lining up and squaring off adjusting to get things perfect. I don't know if the tension from the off corner made it more difficult or if getting an exact 90 will require this much adjustment every time. I think this has to be as good as clamping to a square, but it wasn't trivial.Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase. The construction of the clamp seems robust. The quick adjustment is convenient for quickly adjusting as long as there wasn't tension. The handles are plastic. Hopefully, they will hold up. The one thing that was disappointing is the clamps left significant black marks where they were tightened down. My bookcase had to be finished in sections with final assembly in place. I used some T-shirt rags under the clamps to prevent marring on the polyurethane finish. It was a bit of a pain, but worked out. My other strait clamps didn't have that problem.The clamps also have to be located on the outside of the corner. I have staggered shelves on my bookcase which prevented use of the clamps where clamping onto a square could have been easily done.

",Size: Medium,"Bought this in addition to one I already had.  Have been doing some woodworking projects including building picture frames and this is one really useful tool.  Only issue I had was (having only one) I had to glue up two sections of frame at a time then (when the glue was dry) build up another set and finally attach the two sections with one end unclamped.  Now I can build both sections, let dry and complete the frame holding both corners for glue up.  The advantage is that your corners will be exactly 90 degrees with no misalignment and a perfect miter joint in all four corners.  Lots of room in case you want to drive a wire brad or two while in alignment as the tool has space for driving the brad.Invaluable for making precise, professional looking picture frames!  Only criticism is that the clamp should be sold in a set of 2 (maybe with a little discount).  Highly recommended!

Or weld up half the project. Let it cool and work the other side. It's not designed to put any pressure on your project, it's only designed to hold everything in place at a 90° angle.

",Size: Medium,"These clamps are great. I just finished a set of built-in bookcases, and these clamps came in very handy.

They kept the cabinets at right angles until I could get proper clamps and screws done. They don't get in the way, yet are very strong. The all metal construction makes them very sturdy - better than plastic ones. You can also mount them to a work surface at the appropriate dimensions and really churn through the operation. I didn't use it, but they are engineered to let you work a miter while the pieces are clamped up.I won't build another set of cabinets without them. Well, because I own them, but if I didn't have them, I would buy again.

I was using Spax screws so didn't have to drill pilot holes, but if I had, I could have with no fears that there would be slippage. I wish I had had these for other projects.Handles 2"" thick lumber with no issues.Very good - happy to have them.

I like the fact that I can (now) connect two pieces of wood at a 90 degree angle with repeatability. Prior to this purchase, it was a ""good enough"" procedure. It is difficult as of this first use review, though, to gauge the alignment of the clamp for clamping my work; frustrating, as I have used many other tools in my life, none of them for woodworking. I am happy to have these; the quality, however, is suspect. I have used enough substandard tools to recognize them. I am a (new) hobbyist, so I feel that I will not expose any inherent weakness during my infrequent use. I would purchase this product again.

B000JCGYD6,wolfcraft 3415405 Quick-Jaw Right Angle 90 Degree Corner Clamp,4.0,"good product, good custom service
",Size: Medium,"when it works, it is a great product. Mine stopped working after 3 months. one of the handles stuck and can not be adjusted, which makes it useless.update on Augst 7, 2012: I called the company and complained about the problem (they have 5 years warranty). They sent me a replacement free of charge. In the meanwhile, I investegated the one that stopped working. It was found out the moving part was too tight on the track that got stuck. It could be adjusted again if I use hand to move the moving part instead of using the handle. After receiving the replacement, i found the new one does not have the same problem. I guess they made improvement on either production or QC. I would upgrade it to FOUR stars.

",Size: Medium,"I bought this angle clamp in January 2015 AND here it is June 8, 2016 posting my review. I normally hold off on writing reviews on tools I buy for this very reason. I had used the Wolfcraft 3415405 Right Angle Clamp pretty regularly for building different pieces of furniture and cabinet frames, but about 4 months ago I started having issues with the lock on the clamp not holding. It looks to be well build and it’s a good design, but there may be an internal screw broken that keeps the clamp from tightening. If you know anything about woodworking, this is NOT GOOD. The reason for clamps is to hold your pieces tight for gluing or nailing or cutting. When this product worked in 2015 is was great, but not long after I now have a right angle clamp that does not work. I would NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT….look for a different right angle clamp. THIS THING DID NOT LAST and this type of tool should be built to last for longer than 14 months!Very Disappointed,Ben

B000JCGYD6,wolfcraft 3415405 Quick-Jaw Right Angle 90 Degree Corner Clamp,4.0,"Good-to-go
",Size: Medium,"The price was good and the shipping was relatively fast.  Theses right angle clamps make squaring work easier and faster.  You can use the Pythagorean Theorem (length (squared) + width (squared)= x(squared), which is the hypotenuse angle or in this case the diagonal from corner to corner)). Then find the square root of ""x""(squared) to determine the diagonal length (hypotenuse) to calculate what the length squaring should be.I've read some posts that just mention squaring the cabinet but if the carcase needs to be 30"" tall and 20"" wide, make sure you square it to the results of the Pythagorean Theorem's calculations.  If the results for a 86"" x 36"" closet carcase is 236.806cm (or 93.23""), then you diagonal measurements for square on the carcase should be just that, 236.806cm (or 93.23"").  I prefer using the metric system so I don't have to do more math to figure out what .23 is or where it is on my tape measure, and no, you can't use 1/4"" nor 3/16"" because it lies in between the two.  In fact, it lies very close to 15/64"", which is very good for cabinet work!  Centimeters and millimeter are MUCH easier to find and convert to each other, just move the decimal point to the left or right one space and round off, so 236.806 could be 236.8 or 236.81, which are easier to measure using a metric tape measure!  Don't just come up with whatever the tape measure reads and if you're within 1/8th, then you're good-to-go.  NO!  You're not good-to-go!  Don't try to just make numbers match (if they're not the correct hypotenuse angle length).  Calculate what the hypotenuse, long angle, or diagonal square dimension should be and shoot for that number.  Shoddy work will come back to haunt you, especially with moving parts like drawers and pullouts.  If you're doing frameless work, your work will show up as quality work or as crap, trust me.  If your cuts are square, then you won't have any problems, but the assembly must be square as well (even square cuts could end up a parallelogram).Just use these right angle clamps as a jig (once you calculated the hypotenuse angle) and secure the jigs onto your workbench or build table to that dimension (in my example, 236.806cm (or 93.23"").  After that, simply insert the lumber into the clamp and the assembly will be square (because the placement of the clamps is square, so anything attached to the clamp will be square).  No need for having to rack into square or trying to beat the glue time.  Jigs are helpful for these reasons and all your cabinets will be the exact same dimensions (barring bowed, cupped, or unplaned plywood to begin with).  Usually, if you have quality plywood to begin with and cut everything square, the jigs will provide a mechanical means of ""square"" for you.If I need any more woodworking tools, I'll surely consider shopping here again.

",Size: Medium,"I use these for aligning and holding two boards together while drilling holes for screws. They work great for that!All you need is a hand drill and these clamps plus a decent drill bit.If you use wood screws, use a tapered bit.If you use drywall or ""multi-purpose"" screws, then just drill a slim pilot hole.If you use machine screws, then use a self tapping bit.If you are ""directionally challenged,"" ( meaning; you can't drill straight) then use a drill guide.Even if your holes are a little off, the boards will come together straight because they were aligned when you drilled the holes.I have used these for aligning all sorts of work: casework, cabinets, fences, shelving, jigs & fixtures, tool-box carcasses... you name it.You need two of them. That's no problem since they are usually sold in pairs.BTW, you will save a little money (about 25% to 30%) if you do buy them packaged in pairs.Having raved about these for this purpose, I must point out: they are not that great for actually clamping during glue-ups. They are not designed to bring corners together. They are designed to hold corners in place. So, just be aware of that. If you use screws to bring edge-joints together, then these are great. If you are trying to apply clamping pressure, you need another system.Think of them as an extra pair of hands that hold things squarely. Use them for that purpose and you won't be disappointed.

",Size: Medium,"I unfortunately purchased this at a B&M store and didn't have the benefit of the reviews here.  I also made the mistake of purchasing it in advance of a project and not testing it out for a while.  When I did use the clamp, within a few applications, I ended up with the same ""stripping"" issue as the others have already noted.  The process of tightening one of the clamps somehow engages the quick release button, which promptly releases the clamp (making it feel like it's stripped).  I reached out to Wolfcraft, who redirected me to the Mibro Group (the North American Distributor), who refused to replace the product under warranty, because I did not retain the receipt.  I pointed out that I am happy to send the faulty clamp, which is clearly brand new, and we're talking about a known, recurring design flaw with their product.  But no luck.  Lesson learned (shop with an electronic trail so you don't have to worry about a paper receipt later).

The thread crapped out within a few days...... but I don't give up easily.Here is what to do to turn the Wolfcraft products using this ""quick release"" mechanism from a piece of useless crap into working the way they should.The cost of the modification is probably less than a cent.Here is the mod.1. Remove the red ""quick release"" button by simply pulling it out with your fingers or a flat screwdriver. You may not need to even remove it.You will fully expose the rectangular plunger used to activate the release.2. Take a 5/64 drill bit and make sure the release is fully OUT ie not depressed.3. Drill a hole in the soft metal with the hole being as close as possible to where it enters the mechanism. Go straight through the block.4. Clean up and drop a small nail into the new hole.5. It will never strip out again. Simply pull the nail out when you want to use the ""QR"" button.6. Problem solved and NOW its a useful tool!!!!You are welcome!!!

The lyrics really remind me of Morrissey, Talking Heads, and other kind of edgy yet fun New Wave artists of the 80s and early 90s. I swear there are even some lyrics where she refers to some of their lyrics (Dreaming by Blondie). Anyway, I love it.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"New Style, Same Paramore
",,"First off, this vinyl was so visually appealing (I have the white marble version) and it is hard for me to keep my hands off of it, because the marble looks just that good- very real and beautiful, like an actual marble counter that I wanted to slide my hands across. This is one of my favourite album designs since the (almost completely) translucent Vessel vinyl by twentyonepilots (an excellent group also signed to FUELEDBYRAMEN liked Paramore). Okay, so for the actual review of the product? The folder style album holder is very well constructed, feels durable, and gives plenty of eye candy. And once I got to the music, it was clear that this album was worth every. single. penny. Now, I have to admit: when the first song began, I thought I had somehow put on the wrong album, because their sound has changed significantly, but if there were ever a time when change was a good thing, this would be that time, hands down. I loved their old sound and I still do, but what they managed to do on this album is phenomenal and if you aren't paying attention, you almost miss it. Paramore managed to outdo themselves after albums like Riot! and Paramore. While this is not the kind of rock I was expecting, it is exactly Paramore's style and resonates with me on such a deep level. The music has a Rock SynthPop vibe, a depressed, pessimistic rocker meets Hawaiian Getaway feel and the juxtaposition between light-hearted tones and vibing jams & deep, haunting lyrics creates tremendous pieces of music. In fact, the uplifting tone of the music, itself, betraying the tone and message of the songs is a device they use that can easily be overlooked. It allows that, while on the outside someone may play the part of the happy-go-lucky kid for you guys (the plucky music), in reality, they are tired and they are sad (the lyrics revealing the true nature of the song). Hayley says it best, herself, “I'm so fake happy.” This choice to have upbeat, cheerful music that does not match the mood of the songs reflects the mood and “message” of the album, at least that's how I interpreted it. Hard Times, Fake Happy, Told You So, and Rose Coloured Boy are my top favourite four songs from this album, but the entire album is full of bangers and jams that will make you throw your arms up and dance while simultaneously throwing you into an existential depression. A+ content. I feel like this album is definitely on par with the best of their past discography and resonates deeply with a lot of people. I bought this album after hearing a 6 second video that had just 5 seconds of audio from Hard Times in it, and I immediately bought the album without listening to the whole song OR listening to any of the rest of the album, because when I heard that THAT sound was Paramore and that THOSE lyrics were backed by that sound, I wanted to experience it all in one sitting from a vinyl record, regardless of if the album was good or not. My friend said it was a risky gamble at best and a foolish purchase at worst, especially since it was vinyl. ""They love to say they told me so,"" but it's not gambling if it's a sure thing, and in my long experience with Hayley and Paramore, they are ALWAYS a sure thing.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"Unexpectedly mature and fresh
",,"I used to listen to Paramore's older stuff when I was younger, and had a bit more teenage angst. As I grew up, I drifted away from punk/pop-punk music, and didn't really find myself playing their albums as often as I used to. However, when this came out, I figured I'd at least give it a listen. I'm extremely glad I did.After Laughter is definitely a different direction for the band, and the album is heavily influenced by 80's pop. I don't love every song on the album, but some of them really shine. As a collective musical ensemble, the album is incredibly cohesive and flows really nicely. The juxtaposition of upbeat instrumentals and depressing lyrics makes for an album that seems a little more ""grown up"". This album demonstrates a lot of the versatility of the band, and while I wasn't expecting to love this album, I ended up buying it on CD and listening to it frequently. Definitely recommend.

Simply switching genres doesn't indicate selling out; only following trends and a severe drop in quality of the lyrical content do. While Paramore certainly isn't the first band to go 80s synth-pop, they didn't seem to be doing it just due to the trend; it felt genuine, and the lyrics were just as well written and meaningful as before. I personally feel it would be more of a sellout move for them to continue making records like RIOT! or brand new eyes, since that would just be pandering to their already established fan base. It was a pretty big risk to pull a complete 180 like that. Also, another thing we have to remember is that Taylor just writes songs differently than Josh. Their past two re it's a have sounded so different fron their previous work for this very reason. I personally loved this album. I'm a sucker for happy, upbeat songs with depressing lyrics, and this album was full of that. From all-out bops like Rose Colored Boy to heartfelt acoustic numbers like 26, this album is amazing. I highly encourage you to to into this album with an open mind, and try not to compare it to their previous albums. It's great in it's own right, and shouldn't be looked down upon due to the stark differences between it and its predecessors.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"Happier attitude gains a convert
",,"I have never listened to Paramore much because they fell into the category of ""complaint rock"" in my opinion.  There was always something about their sound that made me curious and there were a few songs that I liked - most notably ""The Only Exception"" - but I was never moved to buy an album.  That changed when I heard the single, ""Still Into You"".  It was such a happy, fun song that I couldn't help but check out the album.  When I did, I was sold.  This album is definitely a new attitude for Paramore, something they readily admit and are a little nervous about.  I am sure some of their devoted fan base will miss the old anger but I do not and I am sure many others will be pleased by the refreshingly fun feel to these tracks.  My favorite track is ""Hate To See Your Heart Break"" which is one of the least ""fun"" tracks but I just can't say enough about it.  It gently falls on your ears like soft rain at the end of a long, hot day.  It is a true breakup lullaby.  I also especially like the infectiously driving track ""Fast In My Car"" and the hilarious ""(One Of Those) Crazy Girls"" but I find the entire album well crafted and really enjoyable all the way through.  We all know how rare that is.  I personally feel this album is a candidate for the best album of the year.

The outer/artwork sleeve is a matte cardboard finish, and the art doesn’t look pixelated.

At first listen I didn't really know what to think of the album because it didn't sound like Paramore of the ""Riot!"" days. It wasn't what I was expecting and I waited a few days and listened again with different expectations. That listen made me realize it is actually an extremely solid album, just with a different but just as good sound, possibly even better in ways. I'd definitely say this year it has been the best album I've bought, definitely worth the money. The more I listen to it the more I like it, there aren't really too many poor songs on the album which was one of the things I liked about ""Riot!"" I can actually listen to the whole album without skipping songs. Looking forward to more of their music.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"Still Paramore
",,"Haley Williams is commited to self-reliance,  isn't angry anymore,  and not only accepts but embraces the real world in her latest victory.  The only weakness the album has in my opinion is that it is somewhat understated - I would love to hear her belt out the vocals the way she did in the song ""Decode"".  There will be some who cannot accept the toned-down Paramore,  but the songs are still of very high quality;  I would describe Haley Williams as one of the best women songwriters of our time.  The punk feel has been replaced by alternating versions of pop and rock,  with some influences from other musical works - a gospel choir, ukuleles.  At times it is as soft as a Suzanne Vega album,  but not usually.  Songs I would rate lower than a B-:  none.  A+ song: ""Ain't It Fun"".  Songs to consider downloading if you don't want to commit to the full album:  ""Fast In My Car"", ""Grow Up"", ""Daydreaming"", ""Ain't it Fun"", ""Part II"", ""Still Into You"", ""Anklebiters"", ""Proof"", and ""Hate to See Your Heart Break"".  I would bet that most Paramore fans will embrace the new,  more mature version of the band.  But for those who can't, I understand - I was never able to accept the new Metallica either.  Stay in love with music!

So I listened through the entire album and I ended up hooked. With the entire album put on a loop I had a hard time turning it off. There happened to only be a single song that I had to skip over and I almost can't even justify it as a song. ""No Friend"" is supposed to be an ""outro"" to Idle Worship and on my first listen, I thought it was.

The front cover image is cool, and the CD itself is a beautiful matte black. As for the music, if you are a fan and would like to know another fan's take on the album, this is mine:I personally love every song. Some people are saying that they don't like it because it's more upbeat than they are used to, but I like this touch of Paramore. A lot of their songs are very sad or very serious, and a lot of the songs on this album are very cute and upbeat. Especially their new hit, Still Into You. I love this song. I think it's cute and honestly, I don't think saying it's cute is a bad thing. I think that with the loss of the Farro brothers in the bad, a change was necessary and inevitable.When people complain that they ""miss how the band used to be"" I don't really understand that. Bands, just like all people on this planet, need to be able to grow, explore, and change. If any band were to stay the same through their whole career, there would be no career because no one would listen to their music due to the fact that it would be repetitive. Paramore has gone through a change, and I think it's a wonderful one. I cannot wait until they release more albums so I can collect all of those too (:

It doesn't affect the music at all, it still plays quite normally. There's just a slight ""flit"" or soft static kind of noise in the background whenever it passes under the needle.

If you have been browsing Pitchfork for the last 20 years; not possible but  go with the metaphor,this recording is going to seriously mess with your mind.Paramore packs a phrase, note, or vocal inflection from a hundred different other recordings into almost every track. They sound totally fresh and original, because they have absorbed their musical roots, and turned it into their own creations, but to me, every song is like living in multiple alternate musical universes at the same time.So each song evolves, slowly,  as you sort out the influences, but they sound great from the first play.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,4.0,"4.5 out of 5 A Great Comeback
",,"It's been almost 4 years since the last Paramore studio album. It's worth the wait. This album is different compared to the previous albums. And this album has several different moods and style. It makes it very fun to listen to. There aren't any hard rock songs like Crushcrushcrush or Emergency. But, it's still a great Paramore album. Don't be fooled by the long list of songs. There are 14 songs just like any other normal studio album, but there are three interludes. Many of the songs are at least 4 star songs. It's really worth buying the whole album instead of individual songs, wether you're a fan or not. I'd rank this CD higher than Brand New Eyes. It knocks that album out of the park and puts it to shame.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"Solid album, Welcome back Paramore!
",,"Since most people have already reviewed the music itself on this thread, I chose to describe the Vinyl packaging itself in this review.  This album is spread over two regular weight vinyl LPs.  Would have liked to see them be pressed on 180 gram vinyl, but oh well.  The vinyl color is black, and the center labels are different colors for each side. This is NOT a gatefold album, and both LPs are housed in the main opening.  It does include a colorful lyric sheet, but does NOT include a high quality download of the album (although the AutoRip from Amazon function takes care of that!).  The sound quality on the vinyls is excellent.  Couldn't hear any distortion and/or glitches with the audio quality at all.  If anything, it sounds even richer and more enhanced than its CD/MP3 counterparts.  Overall, I was very happy with the double vinyl set and feel like it is worth a purchase!

I probably would have ignored half of all Paramore songs if I had discovered Paramore after the release of this self-titled album because I would have thought of them to be either cliché, too optimistic/positive, too corny, too 'not-exactly-my-style', or all of the above. I have loved Paramore, and their past and present band members, for many, many years now, and not just for their talent, but also for their genuine acts and words towards their fans and their meaningful music, so the positivity and uniqueness of this album could not (and will not) draw me away. Whether the songs of the album seem to be cliché and corny, or not, all of the songs as a whole still have this one important purpose: to make listeners happy. In my opinion, the mission has been accomplished.The album is well worth the money. It includes seventeen songs, three of them being interludes, and my purchase came with a digital version of the album to my Amazon cloud, which I am so very grateful for.Was this honest review helpful?

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"Eclectic and Infectious Sounds
",,"Paramore has come along and their self-titled album appears to be appropriately named.  The entire album from track one to sixteen is utmost power driven pop music that bears many comparisons that continue to go through this listener’s head even at the last spin of the final track.  From the grunge to dance pop sounds that resonate with much of the sound of the 1980s and 1990s, the album is sure to please.  Paramore and producers Justin Meldel-Johnson and Ilan Rubin played an enormous part to the sounds heard on the record that echo much with Brian Eno and Nile Rodgers.Imagine growing up in the 1980s and hearing the opening drum rolls of any fast-paced Blondie song such as “Dreaming” and the pounding done by Clem Burke, “Day Dreaming” and “Fast in My Car” have that sound.  Also, one wonders was the band listening to early U2 or Echo and the Bunnymen for the atmospheric “Part II.”  Most of the songs on the album contain keyboards and synthesizers and that big production sound of the 80’s but not so much bordering on Cyndi Lauper’s “Girls Just Want to Have Fun,” but “Grow Up” comes close.  Within the same lines of Lauper, Hayley Williams adds a bit ukele a la Rudy Vallee with “Interlude Moving On” “Interlude Holiday,”  “Interlude I’m Not Angry Anymore.”  And the singles are quite enticing to listen to “Still into You” and “Ain’t it Fun,” which is reminiscent of the funk and pop of Teen Marie with its very danceable beat and unforgettable lyrics.  “Be Alone” is the most power pop song on the record and “Proof” and “Future” has grunge-Seattle style written all over each one.The band has produced a very eclectic album that may appeal to every listener that is interested in wanting to know the sound that is Paramore.  This is the album that unveils the infectious vocals of Hayley Williams and the musicianship of Jeremy Davis and Taylor York and that Paramore sound.

This is the first full Paramore album I've bought, so I was unaware that they had a strong punk-pop vibe beyond the more unique, kickass sound of their singles. They're a ""Fueled by Ramen"" Artist and absolutely can hang with anyone else in that label there. So if you like that kind of stuff, you'll like every song here, because that's what the WORST they do sounds like. The best they can do? Well, you've heard the singles off the album by now hopefully. It not, go listen to, ""Ain't it Fun"" or ""Still Into You"" a.s.a.p. There's also songs like ""Anklebiters"" and ""Daydreaming"" here that are fantastic in the same vein. And some stuff that's fantastic but show a little bit of a different side, like ""(One of those) Crazy Girls"" with it's more playful melody or the slower jam sounds of ""Hate to See Your Heart Break"". They hit a lot of bases on this album and pretty much everything sounds great.Even the interludes are really neat. The completely chill sound of ""I'm not angry anymore"" with it's ukulele is awesome in its own, unique way.Absolutely recommended. This band is killer and their self-titled CD doesn't disappoint.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"Lots of change...and change is good.
",,"Paramore is a band that I have been following since they made their mark on the music world around 2007-2008 and I have been eagerly anticipating the 4th self-titled album. I knew that there was a lot of change coming especially since this band has gone from a quintet to a three man band. Basically, this is not like the past three albums and where this band is going is still a bit of a mystery. There are a lot of different sounds represented in this album. From new wave, pop and indi (featured in the interludes) Haley Williams has definitely come a long way. Her high volume blasts have turned into very mellow and soulful ones and she has become quite dynamic by setting all the different tones for each song. No two songs are quite the same in this record and that makes each one a good listen. I would have to say my favorite song on this album would probably be 'Daydreaming' like most songs I enjoy this one just has one of those hookey choruses that I love.Like all the bands I enjoy listening to, I always enjoy something fresh and new. Still, it always leaves me wondering what will be coming down in the line the future. So far based on what Paramore gave me this time around, I am ready to see what I will get.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"It's pretty optimistic for a pessimistic band...
",,"This album has more synthiness than their ""old"" stuff.  If that bothers you, then I really must question why you even listen to music...unless you're a cantankerous 65 year old who needs their music to have some sliver of resemblance to whatever you considered ""hip"" back in 1970...I'm 32 and I like this CD.  The genre of this album is the same as RIOT!, this is not bubblegum pop any more so than RIOT! was.  That being said, it is a much better album.  It's so good I have a hard time getting to enjoy the whole thing.  I get track 4 and I'm so pumped up I need to take a break.  It's got more life to it than their older stuff.  It's not as negative, but it still has a hint of melancholy throughout, some songs more than others...It's very melodic, Hayley Williams voice shines like always and the guitars are not missing.  I would imagine Paramore hires a touring guitarist since it does sound like either two guitarists playing or multiple layers of guitar, on a lot of the album.  This album benefits from more open-ness in the production.  I go back and listen to ""For A Pessimist I'm Pretty Optimistic"" and the music sounds like a scratched up vinyl record.  And then the second track on RIOT!, ""That's What You Get"", just sounds shallow.  And when I say ""sounds"", I'm not referring to the ""heart and soul"" of the song, I'm just referring to the sound itself.  (People should quit saying things they don't mean and leaving others' to ""use common sense"" as a means to put words in other people's mouths.)

This album is a great mix of different genres along with interludes that mold every track together. I can feel that they've grown as friends, band mates, musicians and people the more I listen to this album.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"Reviews are subjective
",,"After reading some of the initial reviews, I felt like this EP was getting an unfair shake. The reviews suggested that the CD is all over the place, not truly committing to a theme, or following a formula. To those reviewers, I ask, does it have to follow a theme? Is this an opus, or just merely a collection of good songs? I choose the latter.Highlights for me are the 80s rooted ""Ain't It Fun,"" and the call to action of ""Grow Up,"" both with soaring, infectious hooks that really put the magic that Ms. Williams vocals are known for on display. The interludes are fun and playful, and the rest of the tracks are all hits in their own right. Solid effort!

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"They tried some new stuff, it worked for me
",,"Hayley did some great things with her voice on this album and the band branched out into a couple of different musical styles.  A lot of the album had a really nice '80s pop/rock and roll feel to it, and I loved it for that.  I especially appreciated that it was, for the most part, more upbeat than I was expecting it to be.  It's been in my playlist a lot and I like this as much as any Paramore album if only because they didn't descend into too much moperock.  That kind of stuff appeals to kids, but so much of this album is about maturity, growing up and letting go of pasts that anchor you down that when you think about it, freed from yesterday's chains, one should have the spirit to soar.  It's not what I expected, and I loved it for that, too.  Hayley's vocals really showed off a lot more range on this album, and that was probably the most refreshing thing about it.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,3.0,"A definite hit, but not your mother’s Paramore
",,"If there was any question of Paramore’s transition from pop-rock to straight-up pop after the release of 2013’s Self Titled album, After Laughter is the answer.  Hayley’s metamorphosis from an angsty rock goddess to a somehow-even-more angsty pop princess is all but complete.  Those of us that fell in love with the pop-rock Paramore sound from the “All We Know Is Falling” through “Brand New Eyes” era may be disappointed to find a near-total lack of crunchy guitar and head-banging riffs, instead replaced with a collection of catchy earworms reminiscent at times of a popular pop tunes of the 80s.  But is this a bad thing?  That’s a decision best left to the listener.  This sound certainly has a wider appeal, if not alienating some of fans that have been around since the beginning.  Some reviewers call the change in the band’s sound an “evolution”, but I disagree – to me, evolution implies improvement, but the sound is almost so different that it’s impossible to compare to the first three albums.  It’s simply too much of a change.All that said, After Laughter is a fantastic album.  “Hard Times” does a wonderful job of setting the tone with a poppy upbeat sound paired with lyrics that seem to convey the exact opposite.  This premise bleeds into other tracks (“Told You So”, “Fake Happy”, etc.) to the point that it’s a recurring theme of the album.  And while the general sound throughout After Laughter is very much pop, it has a much more classic pop feel, ranging from 80s popular hits to 90s adult contemporary.  The product is an album that is just plain fun to listen to.  I was also happy to hear another experimental track (“No Friend”) continuing the trend from the Self Titled album.So after admitting that After Laughter is a fantastic album, why have I only given it 3 stars?  Personally, I miss the Paramore of old.  If you liked Self Titled, there’s a good chance you’ll love After Laughter.  I’d prefer to see Paramore return to their roots, but I readily admit this album is an artistic achievement and am confident it will be a huge hit.  I’m holding out hope we can get some heavier tracks on the next album, but in the meantime After Laughter will be in my rotation.And as before, I still love you Hayley ;)

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"Paramore is back, Happy, with a few twists.
",,"Okay, so first off, I do not do reviews. I have been an amazon customer for over two years, placing orders on nearly a bi-weekly basis and this is my first review. I just felt that this album deserved it. This album is different from what we expect from Paramore but that is to be expected. With all they have gone through change is due, with losing the Farro Brothers, I'm surprised they managed to remain as true as they did to what we are used to.In this album, we hear a much more optimistic band. With nearly four years since their last album, this album shows paramore taking risks, and emerging from their comfort zone. They are developing their range, and quite frankly I think that's amazing. In this album, many people suggest that the band is more ""pop"", but I don't think these people have listened to the full album. There are some songs up here that are unique to say the least, but you can hear the old paramore we all fell in love with throughout the album. The highlights of this album are Part II, which incorporates lyrics from ""Let the flames begin"" from Riot. This is too awesome to me being able to hear those lyrics revived and relived. Last hope takes us back to the softer paramore, such as the only exception, breath, and many songs from the first album. There are a few other slow songs up here as well, like future and hate to see your heart break. While slow, they show the purity of Hayley's voice. Other highlights include Still into you, and despite having a pop like verse, the chorus takes us back to that alternative band. You find that a lot in this album, verses incorporate things that are totally different from what we are used to, but the choruses often times stay the same, which we see in Still into you, now, Proof, and Ani't it fun. This album shows a funner paramore, in songs like crazy girls, and fast in my car.While it is true they have matured, we see in this album a reborn Paramore. This album is by no means as great as All we know is falling, which in my opinion was their greatest work, but it is still an album that magnifys one of the greatest bands ever. Haley shows us a different side of her, and in the lyrics, we see a band that is so incredibly happy, and optimistic. It is different, and many scruitenize this album because of that, but once you listen to the entire album once, your hooked. You hear the old paramore still in there, alongside a new paramore that is just trying to show how much they have grown in the past four years. Wonderful album, I have listed to it cover to over about eight times, which translates into about nine hours in two days. It is well worth it, and with 17 tracks, you can't go wrong. One note is there are two bonus tracks, which are not included on the physical album but can be listened to on rido for free. These are escape route, which is the old Paramore one hundred percent. I highly recommend you listen to this, because this is by far the best song for this album, and seems like many of the songs on the third album. The other bonus track is ""native tongue"" which is decent, but not the cream of the crop.All in all this album does not disappoint. The cream of the crop lays in Last hope (my personal favorite), Part II, Ain't it fun, crazy girls, proof and the best is escape route, but unfourtantly it's not on the physical album

The interludes with the ukelele are okay but all of the other tracks are heavy-hitting and I've grown quite an attachment to them already. This is going to be played over and over for quite awhile.

I've loved Paramore from the beginning and it's always scary when one of your favorite bands changes/loses band members but this album far surpasses my expectations.  It's a bit more poppy than their previous albums - it's more fun and catchy - less guitar driven but that's NOT a bad thing!  (I detest a lot of pop music don't get me wrong) I love their old stuff and I love this new stuff!  I honestly don't get how there can be bad reviews about this album...those people must just hate the world.  The lyrics are still great and every song is unique.There's a little bit of everything on this album and it's one of the few albums I've bought that I thoroughly LOVED the first time I listened to it.  A lot of times I have to give a new CD (yes I still buy CDs) a few listens before I judge it.  I haven't been so excited about how good a CD is in a long time.Thank you Paramore for staying awesome!

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"This is my first paramore album purchase.
",,"This is my first paramore album purchase. I've heard the singles of her other albums over the years and some I enjoyed and others were ok. I remember a girlfriend years back listening to riot and i was like man, this is mad girl music. I can say that hayley has matured and that this album has a concise theme that touches on subjects that I especially can relate too. Feeling like you have to live up to certain expectations, failure, being scared etc. Everyone can relate to these issues and its refreshing to hear her talk about how she feels. A lot of people think that celebrities or people who are super successful have no problems, but they are people just like us.This album has a very summer feel to it. There are songs that have really good production on this album.Some stand out tracks to me areHard TimesTold you soFake happy26 - changes up the pace, acoustic, real nice song.pool - summer beatidle worship - shows emotion in trying to not disappoint but having to accept that she has to be who she is.Rose-Colored boy has this chant that is catchy: ""Low-key, no pressure, just hang with me and my weather"". Reminds me of the Ting Tings not my name.Caught in the middle has a nice guitar riff.I have only heard the entire album 2 times through and through. I dont think there is a skippable track in this album, it goes by real fast.So basically after saying all of that, as a male, yes this has some feminine tones in it, yes its not the same sad girl music from years back but I feel that this is an honest expression of self and a great record to add to your collection.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"Yet another Paramore that fails to disappoint me.
",,"The minute that I saw that this was out, I ordered it on Amazon Prime before evening listening to any besides ""Hard Times"" and ""Told you So"", so I had a small taste of what to expect. When I first listened to it in my car, I was having a great time just without paying too much attention to lyrics or what the songs were called or anything and thought it was pretty good. The more I listen to it, the more I like it. The only song I don't really get into is ""No Friend"" since IMP they should have the lyrics much more clear so they're much more distinguishable. It's one of those songs that really stands out from the rest; the lyrics, the overall mood of it, and especially that it's not Hayley singing it. It's not that I don't like it, it has some pretty deep lyrics that I'm pretty sure it references a bunch of past Paramore lyrics too.  There are many track on here I find very favorable; Fake Happy, Idle Worship, Pool, Hard Times, Rose-Colored Boy, and Told you So. The rest I also love listening to as well over and over again. They each have their own charm, like the relatable lyrics of ""Fake Happy"" ""..Oh Please! Just don't ask me how I've been. Don't make me play pretend. Oh no! Oh, what's the use? Oh please! I bet everybody here is fake happy too"" or ""Just let me let you downHey, baby I'm not your superhumanAnd if that's what you wantI hate to let you downI got your hopes upNow I got you hopingBut I'm gonna be the one that let you down"" from ""Idle Worship"" I don't know which album of Paramore is my favorite out of ""All we know is falling"", ""Riot!"", ""Brand New Eyes"", ""Paramore"" and now this one. I'm loving this one and am wondering what their next album will sound like when it most likely comes out 2021. Some people may not like that they aren't going back to the kind of sound and energy that is heard from ""Riot!"" but either way, the most important thing is it's the music the makes the band members satisfied with their work. There are going to be haters whether the music goes towards a new direction or stays about the same so they might as well goes with what feels right, and this music definitely feels right to my ears. If you don't like it, that's fine, just accept that, just like a person, it's going to change over time. Thank you for your time.

",,"Yes. I saw the bad reviews, but at 3.99, I thought ""what the hell, it can't be all that bad, can it?""What we have here is a huge shift for Paramore. On the great cosmic Rock-Pop scale of female fronted bands, with The Distillers and L7 at one end and Olivia Newton-John and Justin Bieber at the other, Paramore has slid from somewhere around Joan Jett, blowing right past Evanescence, to end up somewhere just north of Katy Perry.I guess it's really not that bad of an album, if you like that sort of music, which I don't really, then go for it. (And perhaps consider therapy of some sort.)

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,3.0,"Short album of upbeat pop that is ultimiately rather forgettable.
",,"A short, refreshingly upbeat album that is strongly pop-focused but fails to be memorable. A nice exploration into a modern pop sound infused with ventures into distinct decades of musical influence. Fans of early Paramore might not find much to like in this album, as the rock back end that helped Paramore diversify in a crowded market is only loosely present. ""Fake Happy"" and ""Caught in the Middle"" are the closest reminders of songs from Riot! or Brand New Eyes, but would nonetheless feel out of place in comparison. And yet, opening tracks ""Hard Times"" and ""Rose-Colored Boy"" show a creative genius in their use of recognizable 70's and 80's hooks for a modern pop fusion, though they are ultimately as forgettable as the rest. While 2013's self-titled album had hits and misses, it did show a growth and depth that is sadly lacking in After Laughter.Overall, Paramore's latest album has the same beautiful, strong vocals but lacks any semblance of risk. It is an album that feels safe and comfortable. An enjoyable listen but not up to par with any of their other albums to date. Yet another band member lineup adjustment makes a distinct sound difference, and the only thing that remains consistent is Hayley's William's vocals.

It's not as great as Riot!, but it has catchy songs, like ""Still Into You"".  I wish Hayley would stop the lyrics about her public pressure (though I imagine she's been under a lot of it), and just concentrate on more happy thoughts and catchy vocals.  I listened to Riot! again, and realized what really made that sound successful were the guitar riffs and fast drum beats, mixed with Hayley's clear voice.  That potent combination gave their sound a very young energetic vibe.  Josh Farro is just a genius with the guitar.What's with the ukulele in some of the songs on this album?  I don't want to think I'm in Hawaii.. I want some awesome guitar riffs!Finally, what's with the MP3 album costing more than buying the album and downloading the songs instantaneously via Amazon Cloud Player, since this album is supported on AutoRip?

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"Well Worth The Wait
",,"I must admit that for the longest time, i truly despised Paramore. For no particular reason (except maybe their fans, but that's a stupid reason to dislike something). Finally, I listened to Riot! and was hooked instantly (truly shocking because my fave bands are Marilyn Manson, NIN, Ministry, ect). Around that time I started reading all the articles about how Hayley Williams split with the original dudes and was making a dramatic return. I thought that Paramore was probably over before I could even fully get into them.... Skip forward a couple months to the release of the single ""Now"", and i downloaded it cuz...well, it's only a dollar right? I put it onto a random playlist and was blown away by how good it was--almost instantly! Later that night i ordered the album. It was extra tantalizing waiting for the record to arrive, because it took weeks longer than the seller had informed me (that's what i get for going the cheaper route). It was gonna have to be a damn good record for how long i waited for it. Finally, i lost all interest in hearing it as I decided to listen to Riot! on my walk home one warm spring day. It was a semi-rough day, so it felt nice to chill out and listen to it all the way home at a nice, leisurely pace. I got home, and to my amazement, a small brown package laid waiting in my mailbox! This particular album had become something of a ridiculous myth in my mind, so I was slightly hesitant to actually listen to it. I decided to eat some dinner first. The wait eventually became waaaaayyyy too brutal so i put it on while making dinner...WOW. I was astonished by how much i liked it upon first listen! I usually need to warm up to new CDs (even ones that are now my very favorites), so this came as quite a surprise. In fact, EVERY song was 10/10, even the ""Interludes"", which I usually don't like on most records. In short, if you like Paramore, you'll LOVE this album. If you like solid, well-written rock music with infectious hooks, you'll LOVE this album. If you don't know how you feel about them, this is a great one to start with. Another prime example of why 2013 is shaping up to be one of the greatest years in music I've ever experienced. Not to be missed!

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"More variety, still great
",,"Despite losing key songwriters the band was able to put together a great set of interesting and fun songs.  It's not all classic pop-punk, but departures are often the best songs like the funkier ""Ain't It Fun"".  ""Daydreaming"" has an undercurrent of Blondie's ""Dreaming"" to it and the run between it and ""Part II"" is my favorite section of the album.  But right after that you get two classic Paramore style songs in ""Last Hope"" and ""Still Into You"".It's less ""consistent"" than Brand New Eyes but it might be more entertaining in the long run.  Either way, it fits the catalog very well and makes me glad they stuck with it.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,4.0,"If you loved the previous Paramore album, you'll be delighted by this
",,"Paramore has been through so many line-up changes in their history, I've lost track of all the comings and goings. This latest line-up sees the departure of bassist Jeremy David and the return of original drummer Zac Farro. But of course there is one constant in all of this, and that is singer/front woman Hayley Williams.""After Laughter"" (12 tracks; 43 min.) is Paramore's 5th studio album, and once again Williams and Co. deliver the goods, churning out anthem after anthem. The album opens with ""Hard Times"" (1st single), my favorite track of the album. But the highlights are many. Despite the line-up changes, the album sounds surprisingly cohesive. Other highlights include the high energy ""Told You So"", the acoustic ""26"", the rocking ""Grudges"", and towards the very end, the infectious ""No Friend"". At just over 40 min., this album flies by in no time.I had the good fortune of seeing Paramore in concert at the 2014 Bunbury Music Festival here in Cincinnati, when the band was touring in support of the previous (self-titled) album and its monster hit ""Ain't It Fun"". What a great set that was, and the massive audience absolutely loved it. I can only hope they will come back to Cincinnati soon! Meanwhile, ""After Laughter"" is a very satisfactory return of William & Co.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,1.0,"Musically just not good...
",,"Paramore can perform, and put on a show, she has tons of energy and a voice I have fallen in love since day I heard her. I understand the band was trying to show another side of them, I honestly think they should stick to their old style if they want to keep the name PARAMORE. The reason I started to listen to Paramore in the first place was that hard sounding not-so-mainstream rock music where Haley's passionate, powerful, perfectly pitched and extremely flexible, angelical voice that was sent into battle armed with a set of heavy drums, hot-picking power chord distorted guitar. This album did not give me the sensation i got from the rest of Paramore albums. So to anyone that liked Paramore's original style from previous albums such as Riot, this album may be a dud. i have to make one exception ""I am into you"" (thats why i gave it one star. One star for one good song the album had.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,3.0,"Not the old Paramore
",,"Like many, I had been looking forward to this album for years, and like many, I was concerned when I heard that the Farro Bros. left the band.  I was afraid the band would cease being Paramore and instead become The Hayley Williams Experience.  So were those fears warranted?  Sort of.I've listened Paramore (the album) probably 15-20 times now.  My first impression was that it was an eclectic collection of songs cobbled together non-cohesively.  Brand New Eyes, All We Know Is Falling, and, to a lesser extent, Riot, all seem to be relatively cohesive and have a generally consistent, poppy alternative rock style.  This album is largely a break from that formula.  Some songs sound a bit like they would fit in well on one of their older albums, but the bigger story is how many songs do not.  The album almost seems experimental at times, like Hayley is taking the opportunity in the absence of her former bandmates to branch out and see what she can do.  In general, most of the songs are more poppy than previous Paramore works, although some songs seem even heavier and deeper than you might expect (Track 17, ""Future"", comes to mind).So does it work?  For some people it may.  Ask yourself this -- when you buy a CD, do you typically pick a few tracks you like, listen to those, then pretty much ignore the rest of the disc?  If so, you will probably find a few tracks you like here.  If you're more likely to put in a CD, start it on track 1, and listen to it until it hits the end and your player spins down, you might be a little more frustrated by the constantly changing styles you will find here.  Personally, I fit in the latter group, so I was a little disappointed coming off of Brand New Eyes.  That's not to say there aren't some very good songs on this album -- there definitely are, and any true Paramore fan would be missing out by skipping it.  Still, it doesn't feel like it is on the same level as some of their previous works.Overall, this album isn't just a step in a new direction for Paramore, its a step in a lot of new directions.  I'm very interested to see where they go next -- do they return to their roots, continue to experiment, or do something different altogether?  I guess we'll just have to wait and see.Oh, and if you're reading this Hayley, I still love you :-)

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,1.0,"Skip This One
",,"I've been listening to Paramore since they were unknowns years ago. Paramore has always been one of the bands where I can literally listen to every single song and like it. The amazingly artistic instrumentals as well as amazing voice from Hayley is what sold me on this product. Their second album, brand new Eyes, was just as good as the first album. There are a couple of songs I would skip, but 8/10 of the songs are superb. They outdid themselves and lived up to the hype.This album however, does not suit my style at all. I find myself skipping almost every song on the list. About 2/10 of the songs I can bare continue listening to. Hayley still has the voice, but something has changed in the instrumentals and music. It's not as catchy. The style does not fit Paramore. They are moving towards a new direction for some reason and I don't like it. I would not recommend this album. Hopefully the next album they can produce the same music that made me love them.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"FROM A LONGTIME FAN'S PERSPECTIVE
",,"First off, let me just say that I have been a fan of Paramore since they premiered ""Pressure"" on FUSE. I instantly fell in love with them, and they are one of my favorite bands, so this review COULD be a little biased as I truly love everything they do.Now that that's out of the way...This album is unlike anything else I've heard from them. If you are expecting rock from them, and you don't like pop music, you will not like this album. And that's fine! To each their own. I personally enjoy pop music, so I'm happy.As for the songs: ""Hard Times"" is easily the best single they have ever released. When I first heard it though I actually pushed pause a few seconds in because I could tell it was a HUGE departure from their previous work and I was NOT ready for it. Then, I collected myself, opened my mind a little, and listened. And guess what? I loved it. Super catchy. I have no idea why this song isn't a hit. It should be HUGE. So good."" Told You So"" had to grow on me a little. The video really made me love the song. It was what a true music video should be. It really highlighted the song and made me hear new things in it that I wouldn't have caught before.For me, the weakest song on the album is ""Forgiveness."" However, lyrically I can tell that this song was really important for the band. Musically though it just doesn't do anything for me, and it's surrounded by such good songs that I will probably skip it every time. With that said though, I do understand how important that song was to write and I understand why it's on the album.In my opinion, the success of this album has nothing to do with album sales, the success of this album is simply that it even exists. The band overcame a lot to make it, including some inner demons and insecurities, and I for one am just glad they created this! Even though it's pop and so different from what I expected, it seems really genuine to me.And yes, they have changed. They released their first album (and my favorite one) when they were TEENS. To that, I just want to ask, ""Are you the same person you were when you were a teen?"" I hope not! I know I'm not! Expecting a band to stay the same forever is ridiculous. Their instrumentation is SO much better now. They have grown so much and, for me, this is the most collaborative album they've put out. Even in interviews, it seems as though the other band members are speaking up more. People who have accused the band of being ""Hayley's band"" really need to go watch some interviews. Taylor had a huge role in this album, as did Zac. This album really feels like three best friends creating art together and I'm so happy they're happy.My faves are: Hard Times, Idle Worship, Told You So, 26, Tell Me How, Fake Happy, and No Friend. (I'm so glad they put ""No Friend"" on this album. It's awesome and different. Some people won't get it, but that's okay.) Also, I love that ""Pool"" sounds like a 90s love song. I miss that era of music so bad.Give this album a chance, and, at the very least, go check out 26 and Tell Me How! If you love their slow jams, these are GREAT.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"Different but great!
",,"I have been a Paramore fan for a long time now. They are actually my favorite band. With their previous albums there was tons of energy, charisma, and just plain old good music. When I found out that Josh and Zac Farro left the band I was devastated. They were both major assets to the band.When Paramore came out with their Singles EP without the Farro brothers I was hopeful. Their sound was still pretty much intact. I wasn't left disappointed. A little later ""Now"" came out. I liked it but it wasn't quite like the old Paramore. Then ""Still Into You"" came out and I was left a little disappointed. Both singles were great, but the signature sound was gone.Well, their CD came out and I bought it anyway. I have to say that the first listen through wasn't doing too much for me. There were some catchy songs here and there, but the Paramore I used to know was gone. Even Hayley's vocals have slightly changed. But the second time listening through it I realized that this album was extremely well written. The album flows so well together and it just puts you in a great mood. I realized that yes, it isn't the old Paramore, but it shouldn't have to be. These songs are amazing songs that get stuck in your head. I constantly find myself singing songs like ""Grow Up,"" ""Ain't It Fun,"" ""Part II,"" and ""Be Alone.""So there you have it from a big fan who was slightly disappointed at first, I give this album five stars. Listen to it once, and then listen to it again and you'll find yourself loving it more and more with each listen. Each song is different so it is definitely not a boring album. They are still Paramore and still bring great music to the table.

Those songs that you usually might skip on an album is like every song on this album here.I really don't know what crowd this album is suppose to appeal to. The singles may do well enough, but the album as a whole doesn't hold up well. Is it trying to bring in different fans from other genres? At the very least the self-titled album introduced more pop while still providing some rock type songs, but this doesn't follow anything that they've had previously. Trust me when I say I wanted to like the album. I've listened to it 10+ times and at the end of the day it falls on the forgettable side. I wish them the best though.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,2.0,"Not A Laughing Matter
",,"When Paramore released their 2013 self-titled release, many were unsure what Paramore would sound like without the Farro brothers (who gave Paramore its distinctive sound).  The result was an album chocked full of variety and well written songs.  Songs with angst yet catchy like Fast In My Car, Now, and Ankle Biters mixed with poppy upbeat songs like Ain't It Fun, Still Into You, and Daydreaming that gave us a taste of 80's without overdoing it, and then slower songs like Hate To See Your Heartbreak that proved Hayley's talent at any tempo.  It was an album that showed that Paramore was here to stay.  Fast forward four years to the present and now I am left scratching my head.  While the self-titled album had some 80's sounds in various songs, it was not in full force and had just the right amount.  After Laughter, though, is a combination of indie-rock bands (think Coin, Walk The Moon, The 1975) with shimmering guitars but then a wall of noise trying way too hard to be something from the 1980's (with a whole lot of Blondie influences).  Now is this a bad thing?  That depends on what you like.  For me, I would be okay with it in moderation or in a few songs (I enjoyed Hard Times and Caught In The Middle).  But not one song on here in my opinion is near as good as the 7 songs I mentioned above from the self-titled album.  And there lies my main problem with this album.  It is forgettable and not something that I would put on to listen to from beginning to end.  And the fact that Zac Farro is back playing drums, his skills seem non-existent on the album except for the song No Friend, where he is the lone highlight of that odd song.  His under-utilization is reminiscent to MuteMath's ""Vitals"" where Darren King's skills were not on full display.  Here's to hoping that Hayley and Paramore return to their roots in their next album.

This album has brought me into the excitement about them I used to have in middle school. It’s so refreshing to what they’ve made before and in contrast to other music as well. They created songs that I can dance around my room with, songs I cried to, and overall created an album that is great.Haley Williams is again a great reason for me even listening to Paramore and once again her vocals sound amazing. Her voice is so unique and it sounds amazing on every single track on the album. Her songwriting talent paired with the songwriting talent of the guitarist, Taylor York, is wonderful. The lyrics are fun, meaningful and overwhelmingly relatable.Even if you don’t like the complete album, I know there is at least a few songs for everyone.

This new ultra poppy, colorful 80s vibe Paramore has going isn't for everyone. But I promise if you really give it a try, you'll come away with plenty of enjoyment from a lot of songs on this album.Hayley Williams' vocals are on point, and there is a welcome return of founding member Zac Farro on drums. The sound pumps out colorful sounds of synth, funk, and electropop. The album speaks about present-day issues such as stress, tired small talk, depression, aging, among other themes, all in an ironic happy, groovy sound that'll make you forget how deep and sad the lyrics really can be.My personal favorites off this album are ""Forgiveness"", ""Hard Times"", ""Fake Happy"", ""Rose-Colored Boy"", and ""Tell Me How"", but I enjoyed the album in almost its entirety.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"So Far one of the best albums this year....
",,"Paramore has always been a favorite in the pop punk scene, ranging from albums like Riot, Brand New Eyes, and their self titled album, as well as All We Know Is Falling. Now, Paramore have released a rather quick project called 'After Laughter' that gets it sound from stuff on an album from thr 80s, and the results are flawlessly perfect.Hard Times is the first single from the album, in which the change in direction of Sound was first noticed. Then, we get to songs such as 'Rose Colored Boy', something that sounds like a breezy synthpop Taylor Dayne, Madonna tune. Other favorites, 'Forgiveness', a much better remake of the badly awful Tears For Fears 'Everybody Wants To Rule The World', Fake Happy, a tune that begins sort of like a Sheryl Crow ballad, and then get into a catchy pop sound, '26', a mostly acoustic ballad, 'Grudges', a rock song that sounds a bit like a song from the Cure, and my favorite track on here 'Caught In The Middle', a 90s melodic tune that sounds extremely catchy. Other notable stuff on here is that a guy from MeWithoutYou sings on the song 'No Friend' and that every song have relatable lyrics on this album.This album is a phenomenal 97/100, even thought I loved albums like 'Riot' better. I think this album is a great listen, and kind of reminds me of when Carly Rae Jepsen decided to make an album based on the 80s ideaology, only that album was a perfect 100, and this Paramore record goes right below that, but still a purely fantastic listen.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"Upbeat Music + Downbeat Lyrics = Addictively Catchy
",,"How to define Paramore?  Are they pop?  Rock?  Something else entirely?  To be honest, I had always thought of them as catchy rock light, and liked them (or didn't) on a song-by-song basis.  ""After Laughter"" is the first album of theirs that I've listened to as an entire album; with that caveat, I'll boldly claim that it's a departure from their previous sound.  Although it has the same upbeat, infectiously energetic, synthetic background sound, the '80s influence is more strongly marked, and the wistful bittersweetness of the lyrics and vocals, which has always been there in the background, is more pronounced.  The contrast between the light, highly danceable music--with occasional forays into smooth acoustic territory, as in ""26""--and the downbeat lyrics, with songs like ""Hard Times"" and ""Fake Happy,"" could have been a terrible mismatch, but it works beautifully here: the lyrics on heartbreak, depression, and self-sabotage make the album more than just infectious candy pop, while the music takes what could have been a major downer of an album and makes it addictively listenable.The first part of the album is full of theme of heartbreak and depression, something the singer wants to acknowledge and experience fully, spurning the naive attempts on the part of others to convince her to cheer up (e.g., ""Rose-Colored Boy"") or forgive the transgressions of others (""Forgiveness"").  Instead, she says, any happiness she's experiencing is faked (""Fake Happy"").  It is not until the halfway point, song 6 in the 12-song album, in ""26,"" that she is able to turn herself around a little, singing ""Hold onto hope if you've got it/ Don't let it go for nobody.""  In the next song, ""Pool,"" she talks of diving back in--to an unhappy relationship.  In the subsequent songs, e.g., ""Idle Worship,"" which has a return to the strident vocals typical of Paramore's earlier songs, it's the singer who is now the one letting down the other person in the relationship.  Although the album is not a concept album as such, it does contain a (vicious) cycle of hurt and heartbreak.If this sounds overly depressing, it's not--or at least, it's offset by the sunny musical sound, and the occasional flashes of hope, as in ""26"" and the closing track, ""Tell Me How.""  The lyrical voice of the album may not have relationships figured out yet, but she does seem to be figuring out herself, and learning how to withstand the ups and downs that life throws everyone's way.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,4.0,"but the band had to pretend like they were okay when in the public eye
",,"Paramore has been on the frontlines of pop punk music for years, with Hayley Williams solidifying herself as one of the premier female vocalists in modern rock music. That’s why when they took a new direction with their fifth studio album After Laughter fans were surprised with the direction it took. Moving away from the darker songs of past years, Paramore had a sound more reminiscent of the 1980’s on this record, showing a distinct change from the sound that brought them in to the national spotlight. The album has a big focus on Hayley Williams and her dealings with the rest of her group. For years, the media constantly spoke about Hayley Williams leaving the group to pursue solo projects, which created animosity in the group. Many members of Paramore had an issue with Hayley Williams being the only household name in the group. In past years, members have left the group, citing Hayley Williams being the main attraction as the reason for leaving. Thematically, this album takes a more somber approach to dealing with Williams’ emotions and how she has dealt with within group fighting for the past couple of years. One highlight of the album is “Fake Happy” which describes Williams talking about faking her emotions. She talks about putting up a façade and smiling on the outside when on the inside she isn’t. To me, I think this song draws connections to dealing with the drama in the group and how a lot of the fighting was happening behind the scenes, but the band had to pretend like they were okay when in the public eye. While this album does tackle some heavier subjects, there are also some songs that tackles these subjects in an upbeat way. “Hard Times” is an up-tempo song with a catchy chorus, but its subject matter goes a lot deeper. In interviews, Hayley Williams has talked about the meaning of the song, going on to say that it is about dealing with losing members of the band. Like stated before, Paramore has had numerous lineup changes over the years. This is taxing for the band as they constantly redefine their sound and roles in the band. After first listen, I didn’t even know the song had such heavy lyrics because I was too entranced by the melody and Hayley Williams electrifying voice over the smooth guitars. Being able to turn, for lack of a better phrase, hard times into something beneficial like music is important, and Hayley Williams for sure did this when she wrote “Hard Times” as she took the pain from her past and turned into a charting single. The whole album doesn’t just deal with Paramore band drama, it also deals with love and the beginning and ending of relationships. One song that does an especially good job of dealing with this subject is “Pool” a very well-produced song that uses imagery to express its message. Using water and waves as imagery, Hayley Williams talks about being how being in love is like drowning and being stuck underwater, but no matter what you are ready to “dive back into” the love at any moment. The song uses soft vocals and soft bass lines to give the song more of a love song feel, as opposed to an aggressive pop punk record. To me, the song is reminiscent of early 2000’s soft rock in how “unaggressive” it is. Unlike old Paramore projects, this song doesn’t throw the message in your face, it lets the listener unpack the meaning, using imagery to subtly express these feelings of love that Hayley Williams is so wrapped up in. The use of piano and synths on the track gives it an almost haunting sound, just like the haunting thought of drowning in love. I didn’t give this album a chance at first because I had heard rumors of how it was a stray from other Paramore records. I had been a fan of Paramore in my younger years, feeling that their pop punk, don’t care attitudes perfectly embodied the rebellion going on inside my teen mind. While this album did surprise me with how good it turned out to be, I do say that I miss the Paramore of days old. There weren’t any songs on this album I could imagine myself hearing live at Warped Tour and aggressively jumping up and down to. This album changed direction from previous Paramore works in many ways, and I truly would like to see them return to the sound that made them who they are today at some point down the line, but I respect artists changing up their sound for the sake of creative change. While most records on the album do a great job of making themselves stand out, songs like “26” and “Caught in the Middle” don’t do anything to stand out on the record. Personally, I think “Caught in the Middle” sounds way too much like “Fake Happy” and “26” is just flat out boring, not doing anything daring musically, making it seem like a filler track to me. I also was not a fan of the tropical “Tell Me How” which does not seem to fit in the Paramore discography. I personally do not want to hear Hayley Williams sing over a beachy beat, I want to hear her yelling over strong guitar riffs and loud drums. While this album differs from previous Paramore works, I think the album does a really good job of making the statement Hayley Williams intended it to. She expressed her feelings about the band, love, and her past in way that doesn’t make her seem like the invincible rock god she was on previous albums, but then again who is invincible.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,1.0,"What the hell is this!
",,"What the hell is going on here? Did someone kidnap Paramore and replaced them with a mediocre pop band? I really want to know, cause this makes no sense to me. I understand a band's need for change, but at what cost? This sounds nothing like the Paramore I know and love. Where are the hard driving drums, guitars, and high energy sound? Where's Hayley's soaring vocals? What are they trying to accomplish with this drastic change in sound? I wouldn't have mind if this album was actually good, but it's surprisingly bad--almost painful to listen to! The shift is so extreme that it literally hurts my entire head. I don't know what they were thinking, but this is not one of their better ideas. This is not an album I will be purchasing or listening to for any length of time. I will still support the band, but not this album. It's just not very good.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"Paramore delivers a recipe for disaster...And somehow it works
",,"Why is this album so good? Usually when bands try to reinvent their sound out of nowhere, they fall flat on their faces. On top of that '80s style synthpop is one of the most infamous styles of pop music in the last several decades.So Paramore releases an album that reinvents their sound, completely guts a ton of their punk rock roots, and instead veers into '80s style synthpop...and somehow it's actually really good!Why is that the case? Well, possibly for the following reasons:1. Lots of the lyricism is some of the best the band has done. It can get deceptively heavy and deep in many spots, and the contrast between it and the lighter music is executed really well.2. Hayley Williams' vocals and the instrumentation from Taylor York and Zac Farro is as fantastic as ever.3. Despite being inspired from a genre infamous for being generic and often substanceless, there is a ton of meat in the musicality on this album.4. A general high level of consistency.My favorite song is easily Fake Happy.No Friend is probably the only song on here I just don't like. It just doesn't belong and feels like it way overstays its welcome.Definitely give this album a listen. It's always disappointing hearing artists completely lose their touch, so it should be refreshing when Paramore succeeds so well in this new direction.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,4.0,"One of the Year's Pleasant Surprises
",,"Paramore returns after a four year hiatus with the release of 2013's self-titled effort Paramore.  After `09s successful Brand New Eyes, things from an outward perspective seemed to be falling apart for the band, just as success continued to mount.  The exit of the Farro brothers left the question about the future livelihood and lucrativeness of the band, stripped to a trio including Hayley Williams, Taylor York, and Jeremy Davis.  The results end up greatly exceeding expectations, as Paramore is one of the year's better and hottest albums. Add to those accolades a number one debut on the charts, and the coronation is complete.  Justin Meldal-Johnsen handles the production work.""Fast In My Car"" sets the tone, laden with hefty guitar work, pummeling drums, and feisty vocals from Hayley Williams.  ""We're driving fast in my car / we've got our riot gear on but we just want to have fun..."", she sings enthusiastically on the chorus.  ""Now"", similarly, is a ball of energy, finding Williams in tongue-in-cheek mode, stretching out vocal syllables: ""if there's a future, we want it / Now-ow-ow..."". ""Grow Up"" is arguably the best of a fine opening trio, featuring solid songwriting, catchy chorus, and a whiny, invested Williams.  Throw in some 80s synths at the conclusion for good measure, and ""Grow Up"" is rock solid.""Daydreaming"" is equally catchy and memorable, one of the true gems; it benefits from thoughtful development and overall pacing.  After a ukelele-accompanied interlude, the show-stopping ""Ain't It Fun"" gives Paramore one of their best songs, EVER.  The gospel-infused choral vocals truly propel during the vamped sections (""Don't go crying to your mama / cause you're on your own in the real world...""). ""Part II"" proceeds consistently, while ""Last Hope"" impresses with its balance of push and pull, not to mention Jeremy Davis's active bass line.  ""Still Into You"" once more nods to the 80s, with Williams's personality at its most magnetic.""Anklebiters"" is as assertive in sound as it's clever title suggests.  Uptempo punk at it's best, the song isn't even among the best on this ultra consistent set.  Following another ukelele-driven interlude, ""Proof"" possesses a jungle-like quality, given its pounding drums.  It falls short of the elite, but its follow-up ""Hate To See Your Heart Break"" makes the cut, showing William's more tender vocal side.  She and the band contrast smoothness for the `crazed' on ""(One of Those) Crazy Girls"" in which Williams is quick to state ""I'm not one of those crazy girls..."" However after a revealing chorus (""Baby are we over now? Maybe I can change your mind? As soon as you walk out my door / I'm gonna call a hundred times""), the end finds Williams accepting her fate (""Now I'm one of those crazy girls"").A final interlude precedes ""Be Alone"", which is a typical Paramore cut (driving, dirty guitars, Williams assertive).  Closer ""Future"" is more experimental, featuring vocals early on, but conceding most of its duration to instrumental ideas.  All in all, Paramore ends up being an unexpected surprise.  If anything, the exits of Josh and Zac Farro only fueled the fire of the trio, who truly compel to the upmost here.  Enthusiastically recommended.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"One of the strongest albums of 2013.
",,"Nearly 15 months after Paramore's fourth LP was released (April 9, 2013), the band remains as brilliantly defiant as ever.  Unfortunately, as most fans know, Paramore had suffered a 3 year hiatus because of the Farro brother's absence (the 2 brothers left the band of their own volition because of religious/irreconcilable differences).  Now a quartet, Paramore actually sound BETTER for it.  The entire album is much stronger, faster, louder and looser than their previous recordings.  If the one-two punch of ""Fast In My Car"" and ""Now"" doesn't convince anyone that Paramore is here to stay, then just wait until you hear the rest of it.  :)Now I'm going to talk about my personal, most sacred favorite tracks on this record.  First, ""Grow Up"" sounds like a potential kiss off to all the haters -- ""Everybody has to grow up sometimes.../If you don't, I'm gonna leave you behind.""  Next, I love the 3 acoustic guitar interludes from Hayley, which seem to reflect on her current feelings about past and present life in general.""Ain't It Fun"" -- this song just SCREAMS ""number one hit"".  I love the playful, melodic xylophone twinkle at the beginning of the song, right before the crunchy guitars kick in.  And the best part is the choir at the bridge/ending of the song, coupled with Hayley throwing down some serious, mean, soulful vocals!  It can't get much better than that.  :)""Still Into You"" -- still in heavy radio rotation, this song was written about Hayley's current boyfriend.  I can't stop dancing to this song (even if I wanted to), whether I'm at home or driving on the interstate/freeway.  And, my favorite part of the song is the bridge where the extra percussion kicks in.  It just makes you want to get up and MOVE!!  :)""Anklebiters"" -- the band's most punk rock anthem ever, not to mention the shortest.  They pulled it off, once again, with aplomb.""Proof"" and ""Be Alone"" -- more great and familiar melodies that are also surefire hits.Lastly, what causes Paramore to stand out is their live shows.  They have endless bounds of energy and the fans completely feed off of it.  I'm looking forward to their next record -- hopefully we'll get to see one by 2015 or 2016.  I can't wait!!  :)

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,4.0,"Great lyrics, great CD
",,"I am admittedly a newcomer to Paramore.  This 2013 self-titled opus is my first album from them.  I read an article about the band in the local newspaper here and they sounded interesting, a Christian pop-punk/rock band, and then I saw the CD in the new releases rack at Kmart and decided to take the plunge and buy it.  I'm so glad I did.I find frontwoman Hayley Williams to be a very interesting individual.  She is a woman, undeniably very attractive physically, and yet she is 100% convincing as a genuine social misfit/outcast.  I am hit or miss about actually taking the time to read the lyrics to CDs that I buy, but I found Hayley's lyrics here to be very personal, sincere and human.  I also feel a kinship with her because she was born under the astrological sign Capricorn, just as I was, and we in this sign are known to sometimes be misunderstood and reclusive homebodies/introverts.  Hayley's lyrics to ""Be Alone"" read her like a book:  ""What if I don't ever want to leave my house?/Stay on the couch while all my friends are going out.""""Be Alone"" is by the way probably my favorite song here.  It's so honest and real.  It's the second to last song on the CD, and I find the album's second half to be the stronger of the two, as it also has the great second single ""Still Into You.""  I can see why this song propelled the album all the way to the top of the charts for a time in April.  It's that good.  ""Proof"" has a chorus so catchy you will not get it out of your head for days.  And finally, the ballad that follows it ""Hate to See Your Heart Break"" is very soothing and emotionally rich, sounding like it would not be out of place on good Adult Contemporary radio.All in all, a great, positive leaning CD with lyrics you can really feel and tunes you can readily sing along to.  Highly recommended.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,4.0,"I Enjoyed Paramore Before And I Enjoy Them Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
",,"I have to admit it, I was a fan of the Farro Brothers.  The two brothers had such a distinctive sound with Josh's shimmering guitar tones and Zac's attacking approach to the drums.  And while that is missed on this album, Haley Williams and Company have plunged ahead with an enjoyable bag of treats, albeit a mixed bag at times.1. Fast In My Car (10/10): Starts out with a cool little guitar riff.  It's a fun song while at the same time it is a proclamation of who they are now as a band and their new outlook.  It's basically a song about moving on and their ""drive"" to do it.  It's Paramore at the their energetic best.2. Now (10/10): The first single from the new album shows you that Paramore is here to stay.  It has fuzzy guitars, killer vocals, and a mantra of ""If there's a future, we want it NOW.""  It is song of rebirth that is full of hope and adrenaline.3. Grow Up (8/10): Very poppy and it makes me wonder if Haley is channeling her inner Gwen Stefani.  Is this a song a response to Eisley's ""Sad"" that is supposed to be about Haley dating Sherri Dupree's ex, New Found Glory's Chad Gilbert?  Some may think so but I see it as another song in a theme-filled album about maturing and moving on from the past.4. Daydreaming (10/10): As much as I love an energetic Paramore, this slow pop song gets me every time.  I love the music build up and Haley's vocals sound great.  Has a bit of an 80's feel, maybe even a little bit of a Blondie feel to it.5. Interlude: Moving On (7/10): As I mentioned before, there is a theme about maturing and moving on, so it is fitting to have a song called Moving On.  This is one of several interludes with Haley and an ukulele and this is the strongest one.  With lyrics like what follows, it seems clear that it is a song directed at the Farro brothers: ""Let 'em play their song, let 'em say what's right and wrong. Let 'em do their thing, cause it'll never be you and me. We got out own style, we got a way of living life. If they can't get down, well then we don't need them around. Well I could be angry, but you're not worth the fight and besides I'm moving on. I've counted to 10 and now I'm feeling all right. And besides I'm moving, yes I'm moving, besides I'm moving on.""6. Ain't It Fun (10/10): An 80's sounding funky dance/pop song, this is another song that sounds different for Paramore and yet it works.  I love the sarcastic chorus of: ""Ain't it fun living in the real world?""  A very cool bridge as well.  The highlight of the album.7. Part II (5/10): Part II is in reference to being a newly re-written version of ""Let The Flames Begin.""  It is almost as if Paramore is saying we still have our Christian faith intact and that we still have the struggles as all Christians have.  As a fan of the original song, I have to say that I am less of a fan of this version.  It does make you miss the Farro brothers when you hear it.8. Last Hope (8/10): Part II does transition nicely into this song, a song about hope and faith.  I love the lines: ""It's just a spark but it's enough to keep me going. And when it's dark out and no one's around it keeps glowing.""  It's another slower song that builds nicely and the guitar tones are reminiscent of what Josh Farro would write.9. Still Into You (9/10): A nice love song.  Catchy and cutesy.  If the guitars were a little heavier, I think I would have enjoyed it a little more.  This is definitely a song that when you listen to it, you realized just how much Zac Farro's drumming is missed.10. Anklebiters (8/10): Paramore picks up the pace and that might be an understatement.  This song is a nice little punk tune about society's attack on people.  Haley is declaring that she is over all these ""anklebiters"" and is done trying to please everyone.  It goes along with the recurring theme of moving on as a band and as a person.11. Interlude: Holiday (3/10): Another interlude song about moving on and getting a deserved break.  It is short and seems like a filler track (though with 17 tracks total, it is hard to complain).12. Proof (8/10): This song has some cool guitar lines and cool drum beats with a lot of energy.  Seems like a song about long distance relationships which she has a lot of experience in.  About 2/3 of the way into, it gets a nice bouncy feel to the song.13. Hate To See Your Heart Break (9/10): A slower song that uses Haley's lower range.  This has the feel of a country pop song.  I could hear it being used as a country song on the TV show ""Nashville"" or hear a country artist do this song.  I like the emotion in Haley's voice during the chorus.  A very different sound for Paramore but for a group that maturing and moving on, I think it is great.  There is nothing better than a band that can excel at upbeat songs AND slower songs.14. (One Of Those) Crazy Girls (5/10): I'm not crazy about (One Of Those) Crazy Girls.  It does have an interesting slow start that speeds up, but not one of my favorites.15. Interlude: I'm Not Angry Anymore (3/10): Another song about Josh Farro?  At this point, we could all care less since I thought we were moving on.16. Be Alone (8/10): This is one of the more old-Paramore sounding songs.  Nice sounding drums and guitars and Haley's outstanding vocals. Both catchy and energetic, it comes at just the right time in the album.17. Future (7/10):  ""We don't talk about the past; we don't talk about the past now.""  Well, I don't know if that is true but this is a decent ending to an above average album.  The song reminds of the way Anberlin likes to end albums except I wish Paramore had built it into this rocking, epic finale.  Even though the music ends and then they come back in, I feel like they could have and should have gone out a little bigger.In conclusion, I enjoyed this mixed bag of treats.  Sure, there were some lows but there were a lot of high moments.  One thing I did love is although I have been such a fan of Paramore's upbeat/energetic songs, there were some slower songs here that really stuck with me.  And whatever your opinion of Haley, you have to admit she has one of the best vocals out there and proves that she is not limited to a certain genre.  As far as her and the Farro brothers are concerned, I believe there are three sides to every story: hers, theirs, and the truth somewhere in the middle.  We can wonder why Haley was signed before the rest of the band, but at the end of day, Haley chosen then and NOW that she longs to be in a band and not a solo artist.  And I am grateful for that choice.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"Best Paramore Album
",,"Firstly, as a Paramore fan since the beginning, every album has been slightly better than the last. In this case, I would say not only is it Paramore's best album by a long shot, it's a darn fine album for ANY artist to be proud of. The adult woman in me REALLY appreciates Haley's matured voice in these tracks, while the angsty teen leftovers of me still enjoy the more old school feel Paramore songs like ""Be Alone"", ""Anklebiters"" and ""Still Into You"".I'm always wary of albums with interludes, but actually I LOVE all three on this album, and wish they were full songs! They remind me a bit of Ingrid Michaelson, and I'm glad she was able to open up lyrically and not be afraid of sounding anti-Christian. Maybe it was best for the Farro brothers to go.The album closer, ""Future"" is very lovely and progressive, like a rock lullaby. If I were to just hear the guitar/drum work at the end of it randomly, I would never know this was Paramore. It reminds me of Deftones, Tool, etc, and it's very cool.One of the best tracks for me was ""(One Of Those) Crazy Girls"", because it's a great example of a creepy but upbeat song. It actually reminds me a lot of Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill album closer/hidden track ""Your House"" & has a dreamy sound towards the end. ""Part II"" is like a mix of Sia's style, and Freur's ""Doot Doot"". I think it might be Haley's best vocal moment ever at the songs ending. ""Last Hope"" is more of a background song, and is similar to something the band Fun would do. While I didn't much care for ""Daydreaming"", ""Last Hope"" & ""Proof"", I don't mind sitting through them as they flow through the album.My favorite tracks I think stand out the most (and are the most fun/singable) are ""Fast In My Car"", ""Now"", ""Grow Up"", and the best ballad they've ever done, ""Hate To See Your Heartbreak"". I can just picture this song in a movie or tv show scene, or a music video with slowed-down tour moments. For someone who can't stand country, I think it uses the proper elements of it, and makes it better. It actually reminds me a little of the band Eisley.All in all, this is my new favorite album to listen to, Haley sounds the best she ever has, and  everything the band has done up to this point was meant to make an album like this. I'm glad they ventured out and proved they could keep getting better.

The lyrics so candidly talk about depression and being sad in ways other bands and artists have failed.

Yes, Paramore has always had a partly-pop formula, but this time around its less rock and attitude than I ever would have hoped for. Some may argue its a more mature step but I disagree completely. With the exception of a few tracks, the songs feel lazy, uninspired, and teeny-boppery 9that's a word right?) i guess. Its missing that spark. I fear we are seeing the slow but inevitable transformation of Paramore into Haley Williams solo. Don't miss understand, the songs aren't terrible, but a good part of them aren't for me. They are a great band and are capable of much better.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,4.0,"More upbeat and pop than usual, less intense and rock :(
",,"I think my opinion of this album is really affected by my expectations of Paramore. Until this album came out, I LOVED almost every Paramore song. Ironically, the one I didn't like was ""The Only Exception."" Their songs had so much energy and they had a great rock sound. After they lost two of their members, I didn't know what would become of the band. Then the band released ""Monster"" and it was an awesome song and I was really excited to see what they'd do next. This album disappointed me because it's not the same Paramore I expected. Songs sound more upbeat and pop, and not as intense and rock as usual. Maybe it's working for them because ""Still Into You"" is probably their most popular song ever, but it's not what I'm used to hearing as a huge Paramore fan.UPDATE:It took a while but now I'm thinking the album is decent. I still maintain that they've changed their sound, with ""Part II"" being the only one to resemble their original sound, but I've grown to like half of the songs on the album. Four stars out of respect for the band(:

The cd itself is tight and the instruments sound very clean.Haley's voice is always wonderful as others have stated, however she does dig outside the rock/alternative vibe and experiments with soulful/RNB type vocals (listen to ""aint no fun""; has an old school 90's vibe).Overall this is a great cd, and is worth every penny.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"Great departure from their previous work
",,"I've been listening to Paramore for a very long time and this is definitely their most fun album to date! It's a departure from their previous work but they still kept that special thing that makes them awesome. Hayley's vocals are superb! The album is young, free, happy, and even though some of the songs have not-so-happy themes, they're done in super up-beat tunes. I just wanna drive down a long highway with my windows down on a sunny day blasting this, as cheesy as that sounds, haha. Also, I recently saw them live and I was ecstatic to hear they sound even better live! It's just so awesome when you see a band live and they're everything you expected (and more)!

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,3.0,"adjusting the weights
",,"I was really confused as to some of the negative reactions that Paramore received from their previous album, the self titled one from 2013.  At least one person on here accused them of ""going"" bubble-gum pop.  I did not see it that way.  It was the same first energy and pop-punk craftiness that attracted me to 2007's RIOT!  The inclusion of some synths didn't bother me and I barely even noticed it except on the opening segment of the opening track.  This album does indeed see Paramore bowing out of the poppunk arena.  I still would not call this ""bubble gum"" pop, but it's a lot more smooth and a little more laid back than their prior albums.  I was mortified when I first heard this.  But after awhile i found myself singing to the air snippets of ""Rose colored boy"" while cleaning the toilet. And I thought why not give it another chance?  Its no magnum opus.  Maybe this is to their new chapter what ALL WE KNOW IS FAILING was to their 1st 1.  I still an not crazy about that first effort.  Maybe Paramore will do this again and break through with an equivalent to ""Misery Business"".

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,3.0,"Hayley Williams and two guys make an album
",,"Be very clear before you purchase this that this is not the Paramore you know.  This is Hayley Williams' debut solo album.  Riot! in my opinion was one of the best punk/rock/whatever you want to call it albums ever made. Having said that, this new album is not bad.  Hayley obviously wanted a different direction and she does it here.  It is much more reminiscent of No Doubt's ska pop sound.  It is most definitely not a set you'd expect to hear on the Vans Warped tour.  Riot! was perfection for me, and for many fans.  A shame the band members couldn't get through their 'teen and early 20s' angst and keep things going musically.  Here's to hope that in about five years or so they'll get back together and get back to the basics which made Paramore so incredibly popular in the first place.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,4.0,"Paramore?
",,"My feelings about the new Paramore album:During my first listen I was expecting to hear the SAME Paramore from ""All We Know"", ""Riot"", & ""Brand New Eyes"" & all Paramore purists out there will probably do the same. But it's not the same Paramore from those previous masterpieces & I should've known that being that the Farros who began this group are no longer a part of the band. All that being said & after giving it another listen without those expectations I still really like this new album. It offers A LOT of different sounds, but even though its different if you listen closely enough there is still some of that classic Paramore swag there. I would not say that they remain Paramore, its clear that they are something else, but I'm willing to give this new band a try & look forward to what their future holds.Favorites include (in order of tracklisting):1. Fast In My Car2. Now6. Ain't it Fun (in my opinion this has a really different song especially with the choir at the end but its such a fun and happy song)7. Part II9. Still into You (give it a chance. Its the most ""pop"" of the songs in my opinion and it really serves its purpose of being a happy love song about her bf from New Found Glory)10. Anklebiters12. Proof13. Hate to See Your Heart Break (this song is on the line of ""The Only Exception"", not as good sounding but lyrically is a good love song)14. One of those Crazy Girls (retro-sounding song)17. Future (What I love about this song is that it starts off so simplistic but by the end evolves into this HARD guitar focused outro as if meshing together the ""new Paramore"" with the past as they set their sights on their evolution)But these are just my thoughts, if you are expecting the old Paramore you wont blatantly find that here. If you are willing to find out what this new Paramore is all about & aren't going to shun the album on the first round I think you'd be pleasantly surprised by what you find here...

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,3.0,"Paramore Back Again
",,"After a long wait for the new album it has finally arrived.  I was curious to hear the direction Paramore would be heading on their latest effort.  While it may not have the impact of their previous work, it still is a decent record.  This latest album may be missing some of the alternative rock sound and replaced it with pop-rock. I would rate the music around a b- and the lyrics around a c-, although Hayley's voice and vocal patterns make up for some of the imperfections.  It feels very polished and produced almost too much, which seems stale at times. For the fans who are expecting ""All We Know Is Falling"" or ""Riot"" type records I think you will be a little disappointed.  Those who appreciate an album redefining the idea of what Paramore's music means. This will be an alright record to check out.  Personally I feel this album will be worth playing for a month or two but won't be replayed very frequently after.  ""Fast In My Car"", ""Now"", ""Ain't It Fun"", and ""Still In To You"" are the highlights of the album.

So where are Paramore as a group?  The album proves that no one is irreplaceable, so this album is a hearty ""wave goodbye"" to the disenchanted brothers.  The fact that Paramore has soldiered on - indeed successfully - has nailed the doubt issue.  Yes, they can survive.  A lot of new textures and grooves are here and if you're expecting ""That's What You Get"" or ""Misery Business"" you're going to be left out in the cold.  Again...new band members.  So the old groove ain't gonna be there.  Having said that, the new stuff - tho different - is easily some of their best work ever.  Haley's voice goes in to some strange territory on a few numbers but she's still on form and still able to pound out the new material with conviction and feeling.  There are a ton of excellent songs here both to keep old fans and draw new ones in.  ""Daydreaming"" is easily the best song released this year by anyone.  ""Proof,"" ""Ain't It Fun"" and ""Part Two"" are excellent, catchy songs.  Out of five stars, I give this sixteen.

My favorite songs from this album are: Anklebiters, Grow Up, Part II, Still Into You and all of the Interlude titled tracks.If you're on the fence about purchasing the album, I would recommend listening to the tracks a few times because this is a change from the previous albums.

I tried to listen and give it a chance, but I never made it through to the end of any of the songs without wanting to go back to their older albums, which I do really like.

There's danceability, really strong lyrics in spots and very strong vocals. But Paramore is pop-punk and this record is not.At first I was confused as to why they self titled a record to identify a gutted band, but I guess it was to make an example that they didn't quit on Paramore.With Tegan and Sara moving towards sentimental groovy rock, and Taylor Swift coming more towards alternative music, I'm not ready for Hayley to get away from her high-energy, biting intensity.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,2.0,"Paramore..What R U Doin?..Paramore..STAHP
",,"I've been hooked on Paramore since 2007, when Riot broke them into the mainstream. They matured slightly but maintained a pretty similar pop/punk/happy rock sound on Brand New Eyes, another successful album. Since then they've seen lineup changes and taken things in quite a different direction. I certainly hope they won't go further down this road, and I'll try to elaborate why in my review.""Fast In My Car"" opens the album up, and already the band is on half steam. They throw on some poorly concocted riffs and Hayley makes it through the song, but there is absolutely nothing about it that stands out as interesting or memorable. The first single ""Now"" follows, while this one has grown on me, it sounds kind of like they recorded their instruments on seperate continents and threw it all together later. The song is sort of shambling indie rock, only the vocals keep it from toppling over. ""Grow Up"" is another song about someone (a guy who hurt you, Hayley?) who will not grow up, but Paramore are certainly growing up and moving on in the world, look at them go! They've nagged this theme to death on Brand New Eyes already (but at least back then it was set to good music). ""Daydreaming"" is another song sure to grind your gears, it's more like musical nagging than any melodic, awesome kind of rock. I'll sum up every last interlude on the album with my thoughts on the first, ""Moving On""; it's a pointless, distracting, pretentious, wafty piece of filler with Hayley strumming a ukulele and trying to sound incredibly profound. If you have to pack the album with this musical bubble wrap, at least make it a little different - add some different instruments, lead into a song, anything at all. ""Ain't It Fun"" sounds like a rejected Michael Jackson song - a kind of Caribbean wedding muzak piece. It should pick up and go somewhere, but it doesn't. ""Part II"" is the spiritual successor to a far better song - ""Let The Flames Begin"". They prod at the wound only to remind us they were once a great band, by destroying their own music, it only adds insult to injury. It unfortunately sounds like a very half-butted indie rock version, and I say that very sincerely - they've sucked out every single part of it that was good, strong and catchy and replaced it with trudging drum machines and meaningless strumming on guitar strings. ""Last Hope"" is another interlude with drums and that same excuse for guitar work again, it's not a song, don't be fooled. Then, at last, comes the highlight of the album. ""Still Into You"" is an absolutely amazing song. It's everything this album should have been and more. It's got energy, it's got emotion, it's got joy, power and speed, and they actually play guitar and drums on the track! It's infectious, rocky, poppy, it's everything good and right about Paramore. It's the only solid reason to listen to the album whatsoever, and a single that will live on long after the album collects dust in bargain bins all over the world. ""Anklebiters"" follows it, and it's Paramore by the numbers. It's supposed to be fun and infectious but it just comes off as a little obnoxious. Then there's a track called ""Proof"", which I had forgotten about. That says pretty much everything about that track. It's followed by three interludes. ""Be Alone"" is more indie rock with an incredibly awkward melody that shambles around like a drunken embarrassment. The album closes with ""Future"", which is three minutes of interlude and four minutes of noise. The end.I have nothing against Paramore, but if this is the direction they'll continue to pursue, I won't be listening to them for much longer. Hopefully they will come to their senses and realize that rock music can both be fun and go in new directions - they succeeded wonderfully with ""Still Into You"", a song that should be played at weddings, parties and everywhere with sunlight. To summarize, 1.9 stars for ""Still Into You"", 0.1 stars for ""Fast In My Car"" and ""Now"". Use the rest as a coaster for a good beverage while you're listening to ""Still Into You"". That song rocks.

",,"Paramore's self-titled album sounds like their earliest work, but much more matured.

""Fast In My Car"" is an incredible opening number that is enjoyable to drive a sing with.  The single ""Still Into You"" is poignant and relevant.  My other favorite is ""Ain't It Fun,"" which has the musicality of an anthem and appeals to all.  The other track in need of attention is ""I Hate to See Your Heart Break,"" which is a truly different change of pace, but fits well in the track listings and can be enjoyed thoroughly.

From the free, catchy, fun strumming of ""Moving On"", to the furious energy on ""Anklebiters"", to the sexy hooks and symphonic features of ""Crazy Girls"", to the epic, crescendoing conclusion that is built-up in ""Future"", this album is a non-stop musical gem that I'm definitely going to want to sing along to in my car like an awkward lunatic.Well done, Paramore. You have truly impressed and enchanted what was once a casual listener and is now a devout follower. I wish you good luck and good times in all of your shows on tour. :)))

Hayley Williams has grown into this confident artist that isn't afraid to take her voice to another level and get listeners to dance.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"Different sound for the band, but still good
",,"Paramore's self-titled fourth album is a strong follow up to the band's third release ""Brand New Eyes"". The band's sound has changed a bit. Not surprising, since the band's members have changed.  Instead of a straight pop-punk sound, elements of electronic rock, retro new wave, and indie pop have been incorporated into their usual sound.  I do miss the band's old sound a bit.  Hayley's irresistible attitude is less present and the youthful rebellion has weaned. But bands, especially pop-punk bands, have to grow up. And their new sound works well, and they haven't shed most of the things we've come to love about the band. The guitar riffs and percussion pack a punch, Hayley's voice is still awesome, and often the songs are catchy and have great energy.The lyrical content isn't as strong as their last album though.  The production of this album is their strongest, but the songwriting is a step down. ""Brand New Eyes"" has many reflective lyrics, but they are lacking on this album.The opener, ""Fast In My Car"", is a power-pop number the echoes girl-led 80s new wave bands.  ""Now"", the first single, is a edgy number that wouldn't be out of place on their last album. ""Part II"" is one of a few tracks where get experimental.  ""Still Into You"" is another power-pop number. ""Anklebiters"" is straight, unpolished pop-punk. ""Hate To See Your Heart Break"" is one of few ballads on the album. Like a few other tracks, it has an obvious influence of indie singer-songwriter Ingrid Michaelson.(4.25 out of 5 stars)--Isa R Bufano (05.09.2013)

Nevertheless, the first 12 tracks are pretty much an entire album and deserve 5 stars for creativity and giving older fans what they want.

I like how they used their own name as the title, since it's like telling the world Paramore is still here to rock no mater what happened, still Paramore. At least, that's what it's like for me.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"Paramore Is a Different Band, But Still Doesn't Disappoint and Never Will
",,"Even though the Farros left after 'Brand New Eyes', Paramore still are a great band, and this album is proof. This album is new territory but also still has the same Paramore roots. In my opinion, every song is great, and this album really shows Paramore's growth. ""Fast In My Car"" is a great beginning for the record, still sounding like ""Paramore"" but being quite different at the same time. ""Now"" is a heavier track that is amazing, and was a great first taste of this record. ""Grow Up"" is much different from the usual, but has great lyrics and is very catchy. ""Daydreaming"" sounds like Paramore to me, and is very well-written and beautiful. The 3 interludes are quite catchy and different. ""Ain't It Fun"" is really funky with an amazing gospel choir at the end. ""Part II"" is much like Paramore, being the sequel to the RIOT! hit, ""Let the Flames Begin."" Personally my favorite track on the record. ""Last Hope"" is a beautiful, deep song that sounds much like the band we knew. ""Still Into You"" is a catchy, cute, bubbly pop love song. ""Anklebiters"" is a very meaningful, special song that is so well-written! It's as punk as punk can get. ""Proof"" is one of the best songs off here, in my opinion. The music is what makes it stand out from the other songs. ""Hate to See Your Heart Break"" is an amazing, slow song with violins, and it's no doubt one of Paramore's best slow songs. ""One Of Those Crazy Girls"" has a classy style but in a new form. It was a great idea by Paramore! ""Be Alone"" sounds much like Paramore, and has amazing verses! ""Future"" is a long, heavier song that is one of the best songs off here!So in all, this is Paramore's second best album in my opinion. If there's any other album that sounds like this one, it would definitely be RIOT! One of the best albums ever! Highly recommended.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"A much more mature sound
",,"Okay im gonna admit it: I did not like this album the first time hearing it. There were some tracks i liked, but the whole thing just sounded wrong to me. If your an avid Paramore fan who's been listening since their ""Riot!"" days and were expecting their signature rock sound, you may have been disappointed too. But i really wanted to like this album, so i listened to the songs again and it began to grow on me and i realized that these songs are much more mature and grown up then their previous records, lyrically and musically. Their old records were lots of loud music and screaming about being angry, etc. These songs represent freedom and not being angry anymore and to grow up (hence the songs ""Grow Up"", and ""I'm not angry anymore"".) There are some songs i dont really care for (which is something rare when it comes to Paramore), but in general the songs aren't bad. not at all. It takes getting used to, but its really a fantastic record. Theres something for everyone, such as rock songs, pop songs, and even some ukulele in there. Here are my picks for this album:Now: An amazing song, this song is  relatable and catchy. Reminds me of Riot!Still into you: a lot of people didn't like this song, but its soooo catchy!!! its such a happy song.Interlude: Holday: the interludes are genius and Holiday talks about growing up and dealing with real problems and how when your stressed out you need a Vacation (or ""holiday"" as Paramore says it.Interlude: Moving on: this song is soo catchy and talks about moving on from an ex that is with someone else, that would never be the same as it was with them.Interlude: I'm not angry anymore: this song talks about being not angry at someone. this song could be interpreted as anything. (such as an ex, or friends, etc)Last Hope: At first i didn't like this song, but now its one of my favorites from the record. This song talks about having that last glimmer of hope to keep you going.Grow up: this song talks about growing up in life, even if it means having to lose people while doing it.Part II: This song is a sequel to one of my fave paramore songs ""let the flames begin"". at first i did not like it, but now its growing on me.Anklebiters: this song talks about not caring about the haters and is a rock song (like Riot!)Hate to see your heart break: this song is a slow acoustic song about feeling sad when someone you care about is sadEscape Route: this song is a bonus track on the japanese version of the album. Which is a shame since this is an epic song. Its about trying to live your dreams, and not paying attetion to how hard the present is.

Songs like ""Part II"", ""Anklebiters"", and ""Proof"", travel back more to their roots and fans of Paramore will instantly fall in love with them.  Other songs like ""Ain't it fun"" don't have the traditional Paramore feel, but its important to recognize that this is still amazing music.  They have evolved and matured as a band, and as such some of their music has evolved as well.  If you buy the CD you will see what I mean.

I'm sorry if I wanted folk music I would have bought a folk CD.For this CD they drastically changed their sound...and not, in my opinion, for the better. I understand they lost 2 members, but seriously? Why would you change your style and sound so much in just one album? I know some artist want to branch out and see what they can do, but geez ease into it. This whole album jumped around, nothing makes sense and leaves you asking your self ""WTF?""I loved all CD's by Para, so this CD was a great big fat let down. If I could I would return it...

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"A New Band
",,"While I really liked Paramore's first 3 albums, this one really takes them to a new level. On previous albums there were usually a handful of songs that showed flashes of brilliance, while others were easily passed off as filler. Brand New Eyes was the most consistent out of the bunch but still lacked the ambitious spark I always thought they were capable of. A big chunk of their fan base felt like the departure of the Farro brothers was going to be a huge detriment to the group when in reality, it was probably the best thing to ever happen to them.This album is full of diversity and exploration that never existed in the world of Paramore during their first six years as a group. A lot of this might be due to just how young they were when they formed/had big success. They needed time to come into their own, and that along with the big changes they have gone through in recent years has allowed them to grow into an undeniable powerhouse of a band. Elements of Electronica, R&B, Pop, Punk and Folk all flow throughout this record. Hayley Williams and Taylor York have formed a songwriting partnership that could be incredibly good for years to come.Key Tracks:NowAin't It FunDaydreamingAnklebitersHate To See Your Heart BreakGrow UpFast In My CarStill Into YouFuture

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"Wasn't a Paramore fan...
",,"I'm am going to begin by saying that before this album came out I actually didn't like Paramore. I just looked at them as another alternative rock band, and that there wasn't anything special about them. Since the release of ""Now"" I can now say that I am a fan of them. I love the fact that there is not one set genre that the entire album can be put into, it doesn't sound like the same boring thing over, and over, and over again. It's probably because I'm a fan of a lot of different genres, but it in general is just a great album. And I notice a lot of people complaining about lyrical depth with this album... listening to ""I'm not angry anymore"" should give you the hint that this album wasn't going to be about pure hate, or tension. The band built a bridge and got over it. Meaning there isn't going to be another track that has an anger sound to it like ""Ignorance"" for quite sometime until the band fights with each other or Chad and Hayley split (neither or going to happen for probably a real long time). This album is lighter because, when you let something go that was holding you down that's just how you feel. And about the album sounding nothing like the old Paramore, you can still hear it in there I think you really can on ""Still into you"". They never were a hardcore rock band and have released songs that were more poppy then many of the songs on this album.

What's changed is the sound. It feels less like you caught Hayley and the gang reading out of a journal and more like they've taken the time to prepare some poetry or short stories for you. Same source, different vibe. Also, there are funk and pop threads laced into the workings on several songs. In the end, it's an acceptable mix-up that won't hurt your ears at all. Just look at the band's history; how could we ever be surprised that they decided to try to be different this time around?

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"One of the finest bands gives us real music
",,"It has been a long and anticipated wait but it is here and now I will review it honestly.1. Fast In My Car - A good melody and awesome chorus but not would have been my choice as an opener. The song is a different hear than any other album. It's a little No Doubt type. You will think it's weird at first but when you hear it again, you'll get addicted. 8.5/102. Now - The first single from the record. Hayley's best vocals on the record in my opinion. The song is really strong and it is pretty catchy. When I first heard it, it was very weird to me but then I got used to the new style as stated above. The bridge is also awesome. 9.5/103. Grow Up - My personal second favorite on the album. The lyrics and melody are so strong...it's unbelievable. I just think it's one of their songs. 10/104. Daydreaming - This song sounds like a Brand New Eyes song. That itself isn't a bad thing. It is not a bad song...it is actually pretty relaxing. Just not a personal favorite. 8/105. Interlude: Moving On - One of the first ukulele interludes on this record. It is pretty decent...besides it's not a ""real"" song so no rating is needed.6. Ain't It Fun - It is a really good song. It sounds like an R&B song and that is proof that Paramore is a diverse band. 9/107. Part II - My favorite song. It has a part of Conspiracy (All We Know Is Falling) but it is a part to Let The Flames Begin. It is really creative. I love Let The Flames Begin and now there is a part 2!!! 10/108. Lost Hope - An uplifting song. It has a harmonica in it. It is OK...doesn't really stand out much....7.5/109. Still Into You - 3rd favorite song. This is a really addicting song...I've listened to this like 10 times when I heard first. I like the song...the melody is really pretty and it was an awesome pick for 2nd single. It sounds like Paramore. 10/1010. Anklebiters - A punk rock song. Sounds like a Riot! song. The song is really creative. The problem is it is short..9/1011. Interlude: Holiday - 2nd Interlude...I actually like this one better than the other though...12. Proof - This song isn't really a stand out or not really an honorable mention. It is kinda just on the record, lyrics don't really stand out but it is still good...not the best though....7.5/1013. Hate To See Your Heart Break - The song is beautiful but not a favorite at all...like the lyrics though...7.5/1014. (One Of Those) Crazy Girls - The song isn't all that either....It is ok....7.5/1015. Interlude: I'm Not Angry Anymore - Last Interlude....it is ok...16. Be Alone - This album picks up the energy with is kicky song. This is vintage Paramore. Sounds like another Brand New Eyes left over but this song is really energetic and I really like it. 9/1017. Future - This is the slowest and longest song on the record. It starts off really soft but then there comes this great emotional instrumental solo. That's how this song is....It is an amazing closer song....The song kinda sound grunge type to me...9/10Overall, this album proves a lot of people wrong who say that Paramore sticks to the same script. It has tons of variety and and be a listen for everyone, R&B, Country, Alternative, Rock, Pop; etc. It is a great addition to the Paramore library and I can't wait for what else is in store.Many people are worried about the change. Don't be. It doesn't change their formula by a lot. Every song had it's place on the album and the change is not as apparent as Linkin Park. The instruments are not as punk rock but more alternative rock but that is the only different. Buy it Paramore fans and for that matter....buy it music fansP.S. This album does lack in the area of awesome guitar riffs....It is alternative so don't get upset at the guitar work that much...I believe they could have been harder though

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,5.0,"New Paramore Album is full of new sounds.
",,"I have been a long time Paramore fan... I'm talking back when ""Pressure"" premiered on FUSE. Thus, I feel like I can honestly give advice on this album in comparison to their previous ones... And this is definitely not the same ole Paramore. However, they have been changing for quite some time... Their first album was gritty rock. Their second was gritty pop. Their third sort of went back to the feel of their first album, but was definitely more mainstream. This album is the biggest departure in style between albums for them, but, like I said, they have been evolving for a while.Even though this isn't what you'd expect from Paramore, I absolutely loved it.This album is full of sounds I have never heard before, and, although the styles vary on this album, everything ends up being cohesive. (They really took a risk doing all of these styles because it very easily could have been a big, fat mess.)I do have to say though, Hayley doesn't have as many WOW moments on this album, but you can hear the versatility in her voice- something we haven't heard much of before. Even though I would have liked to hear her really push her voice in this way, she definitely DOES push it by changing up her tone and delivery.To make a long review short, I honestly like every song- something that is VERY rare for me. I even like the interludes, which I admit, I was skeptical about at first...as interludes are usually a waste of space. These interludes; however, are there for a purpose, and they bring out a different side to her voice.The standout tracks on this album for me are: Fast in my Car, Daydreaming, Ain't it Fun, Part II, Last Hope, Hate to See Your Heart Break, Proof, and Be Alone (sounds like ""old school"" Paramore.)Best album of the year for me.

There is some Pop, Gospel and of course Rock sounds in this album. My favorite tracks are Fast in My Car, Now, Daydreaming, Grow Up, Still Into You and Ain't it fun. I love every song on the album but, those are my favorites. There is not one song I want to skip while I listen to it. (The interludes are also great.)

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,2.0,"Without Josh and Zac, Paramore drifts into mediocrity
",,"Well, upon hearing that Paramore had lost the Farro brothers from the lineup, I was interested to see what they would do next.  I thought it was interesting that they decided to go on without them, with a trimmed-down lineup, and would release new music under that lineup.  With the song ""Monster"", I found that Paramore still had some essence to them, but it was disappointing in comparison to their past music.  I was hoping that, on the next album, they would do better than this.Unfortunately, that has not happened.  They have instead gone backwards, replacing the lyrics and attitude of their previous efforts with electronics and production to the point where only Hayley's voice is distinguishable.  Josh and Zac were crucial to the band, and this effort clearly demonstrates what happens when they lose such crucial members from the lineup.  Without their musicianship and lyricism, this album is greatly harmed.  The edgy, pop-punk/alternative rock style characteristic of Paramore's previous three efforts is virtually wiped out on this album, replacing it with a watered-down, simplistic powerpop sound that fails to truly do the band, and Hayley Williams' voice, justice.  In short, this album feels more like a Katy Perry or Avril Lavigne effort, rather than a true Paramore effort.As for the tracks, the production is shiny, but as a whole, nearly all of them feel lifeless and hollow (though the songs ""Now"" and ""Still Into You"" admittedly can be earworms).  The song ""Part II"" is the only song that actually FEELS like a true Paramore song on this album, and ""Still Into You"" and ""Be Alone"" show significant elements of Paramore's trademark style, but other than these tracks, the rest of the album is forgettable and shallow.  Perhaps if Paramore would have built upon ""Part II"", ""Be Alone"", and ""Monster"" (and to a certain degree ""Still Into You""), they might have been better able to negate the lineup change.In closing, the loss of Zac and Josh Farro from the band has proven to be devastating to the band, and without their contributions, Paramore has taken a turn for the worse.  Here's to hoping any future albums correct the mistakes made on this effort.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,3.0,"I'm in Here
",,"Unlike other reviewers. I do not find this to be their best sounding album.It is their first album that I have not outright bought...nor do I have any interest in buying it at all.Track by Track:1.Fast in my car-Beginning instrumental sounds to techno but gradually works up to kind of rock-ish.Good for rocking out in the car.Sounds overall like ye olden days of rock-at least what they're trying for. Really sounds like Avril Lavigne-in her early pop days.Too repetitive.2.Now-WORST song on the album-in my opinion.Granted the preview clip of hayley singing Now-ow-ow-ow was enough to rouse fans to excitement. BUT overall the song sound far too much like dubstep to even be considered likable-at least to me.3. Grow up-Not typical Paramore but still likable.Once again overly repetitive.But for me personally...I could try getting used to it.BUT not an immediate favorite.Too Slow...I'm at 1:55 and struggling to keep my eyes open. Then again maybe I won't try this one on my ipod.4.Daydreaming-Starts out too slow-my opinion.Sounds too much like ""Grow up""same type of slow beginning,same beat.5.Interlude:Moving on-Not caring for their Hawaiian beat in this. Short song. A shot at the Farrow brothers.Very Obviously so.Shame.Hayley you are very much not over it then,huh?6.Ain't it fun-80s beat.Don't mind it.Kinda like the retro thing its got going.I can give this a test on my Ipod/Itunes.7.Part 2-You know how Hayley was being all cryptic in the 4 nights,4 sides thing. Its part 2 of ""Let the Flames begin"". I am inclined to like it because part 1 could easily be called on of my favorite songs on AWKIF.But at the same time I'm wondering ""were they running out of ideas and the album said write another one NOW"". Its like finding out your favorite Disney movie is having a sequel forced upon it. Torn.Like it but don't like the idea of it.8.Last Hope-Another depressing sounding song.Repetitive. Putting me to sleep.9.Still Into You-I know many fans...did not like hearing this as the second single off this album.I am not one of them. Its a happy song. I like the happy,lovey dovey song.I really do. It sounds like the Paramore we know and love. I love how its cheeky like ""That's What You Get"". I just like it.10.Anklebiters-Sounds like PARAMORE. Rather than paramore.Rocking out while listening to this.Good message too. You shouldn't care what EVERYBODY thinks.Shortest song on the album. That ISN'T an interlude.11.Interlude:Holiday-Too island-y again. Though, at least...I know someone who can play this on ukelele if they want. Seems simple enough.12.Proof-They're BAAAAAAAAAACK. Well sort of. Another love song.13.Hate to see your heart break-Sad song.slow song.14.(One Of Those)Crazy Girls-Listened to the preview on Itunes....liked it. Listened to the full version...WTF???!!! Is that even Hayley singing. Or is the GUEST singer. More than just another guest singer. Are you guys auditioning a new female vocalist?15.Interlude: I'm not angry anymore- Did you guys record half this album in Hawaii or something??? This is getting old.16.Be Alone-Sexual innuendo song. Why would she wanna hang out with her friends??? When she could BE ALONE with you ;)Too repetitive.17.Future-Semi-boring.slow song.Sorry about the lack of review content for 13 & 14. I'm listening on Youtube and WMG is starting to take all of the lyrics videos down.Probably trying to force us to buy the CD.I'm not a fair-weather fan if I don't love every song they put out. I'm sorry but people saying that is rather disrespectful. We're still fans,too.

",,"I have been a HUGE Paramore fan for years now. Rarely is there a Paramore song that I don't like or can't at least listen to. When I heard about this album I was so freaking excited because they haven't put out any new music in years. I thought about all the amazing new songs I could add to my collection. When I started listening to this album, I found myself skipping song after song, waiting to get to one that would be a hit for me...but that moment NEVER came. I can think of so many amazing songs from their past they've done like ""I Caught Myself"" and ""My Heart"", none of which on this album even come close to touching. There are no really good songs on here in my opinion. I didn't find one single song I actually enjoyed trying to sit through entirely. They have changed their sound/music style. I know that artists want to progress and grow but this feels like regression for them. They were already at the height of their game in the past, so I expected this album to be phenomenal but it was totally disappointing. I am really bummed out about this. Oh well, guess I'll back to listening to the OLD Paramore.

B00C0NFMKI,Paramore,4.0,"80s Throwback That Still Sounds Paramore
",,"Taken completely out of context of the rest of the band's music, After Laughter is good stuff. I'm into the 80s throwback sound a lot of bands are using, so this album's flavor works for me. Paramore's always had a pessimistic outlook, which makes for some satisfying sad person music, and luckily that hasn't changed here, making the album have this awesome contrast of downer lyrics meshing with snappy, bouncy 80s pop production. The band fits pretty naturally into the sound, honestly, and the weird (possibly studio calculated) sound change isn't depressing because the band's soul still feels intact, lyrically and tonally.Taken in the context of the rest of Paramore's music, I have a hard time not being disappointed with a throwback, alt-rock infused pop album after getting such a ripping (and considerably more mature) rock album with their self-titled from 2013. There's nothing close to a Part III on After Laughter - even Still Into You has a little more of a bite to it than most everything on here. But let's not overthink it. Rose Colored Boy, Fake Happy, and pretty much every other one of these tight, sweet songs are pretty killer jams. And underneath the bubble gum veneer, Paramore's soul still lives in its lyrics.Fun album that I'm still enjoying a couple months in, but I am hoping they give their next one more growl and kick, if we're lucky enough to get another.

Last Hope and Future are 2 of my favorite listens from this album. Hope you enjoy it as much as I am.
